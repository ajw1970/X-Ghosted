I have a repo with a dev branch:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/tree/better-testing

My last stable release was:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/releases/tag/stable%2F0.5.5

Since then, I began adding many new features:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/releases/tag/pre-release%2F0.6.0

Those new features worked pretty well but the Tampermonkey userscript was much too aggressive and my x.com account ended up getting locally rate limited for a while.

In order to avoid that, I began working on changes to make it much less aggressive. I don't need it to be faster than normal human use, I only it to be a human helper. 

To that end, I made changes but ended up breaking some of the features that had been working in https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/releases/tag/pre-release%2F0.6.0

You can see the current state of my userscript here:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/blob/cddb6f49412db806155df7bf0ed8ae9d8a0951c5/src/highlight-potential-problems.js

I build that using this:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/blob/5ec70ac55982288d980675e84fba12740a3afda2/build.js

As you can see, that script uses this source template file:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/blob/fcb1378b3027158ec2e2b79fe0d008172eca823d/src/highlight-potential-problems-template.js

I'm now focused on producing a unit testable version of the userscript to verify as much behavior as possible before attempting to test on live x.com servers again. 

To that end, you helped me create these two programs:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/blob/75723991838e326598753b73f6d563aa84d09072/src/xGhosted.js
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/blob/673d19e6e23bf4d3c93f72305dc3c06a6d75548f/src/xGhosted.test.js

While doing so, you helped me build this asciidoc file as a working understanding of expected behavior:
https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted/blob/d769b53d6ce071af0ff03f636f8c48e4bd809476/docs/working-understanding-of-expected-behavior.adoc

How best can we progress with this work while making sure we can quickly regain synchronized understanding of were we left off in the future?
