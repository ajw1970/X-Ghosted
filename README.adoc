:toc: none

xGhosted is a Tampermonkey userscript designed to help X users spot and manage “hanging chads”—lingering replies tied to deleted or problematic posts that might flag your account as low-quality, reducing visibility. With xGhosted, you can easily identify problem posts, check reply threads, and export your findings to stay in control of your X presence.

== Key Features
- *Spot Issues Instantly*: Highlights problematic posts (e.g., unavailable, deleted, or flagged content).  
- *Check Reply Threads*: Dig deeper into suspicious replies with a single click.  
- *Export Data*: Save your findings as a CSV for easy tracking.  
- *User-Friendly Panel*: Manage everything via a draggable, resizable interface.
