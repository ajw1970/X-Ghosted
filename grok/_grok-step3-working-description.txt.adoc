= Grok Step 3: Working Description
:revision-date: March 28, 2025

== Current State
- *UI*: Highlights PROBLEM (red), POTENTIAL_PROBLEM (yellow with eye icons), GOOD (none), UNDEFINED (none). Tags container with `data-xGhosted="posts-container"`, posts with `data-xGhosted="postquality.<quality>"` and `data-xGhosted-id="link"`. CSS highlights via `xGhosted-<quality>`. Fails with message if container’s missing. Panel lists posts, Show/Hide fixed.
- *Core*: Detects post quality via DOM tagging in `xGhosted.js`, persists state (including optional `processedPosts` persistence) with `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`. Manual mode default. Tags posts, skips tagged ones. `checkPostInNewTab` analyzes threads via throttled Promise, `highlightPosts` updates DOM/state. Observer on container with 5s timeout—DOM settling tabled.
- *Tests*: 74 tests passing across 17 suites, ensuring coverage of DOM attributes, CSS classes, and asynchronous rate limit handling.
- *Build*: Esbuild bundles `xGhosted.js` with dependencies into `xGhosted.user.js`—Tampermonkey-ready.

== End Goal: Version 0.6.1 Features
- DOM-driven detection with tagging, CSS highlights, fail-on-missing behavior, refresh handling—all implemented.

== Technical Details
- *Depends On*: `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`, `jest`, JSDOM, `esbuild`, `prettier`.
- *Modules*: `xGhosted.js`, `createPanel.js`, `renderPanel.js`, utils like `postQuality.js`.
- *Build Script*: `build-xGhosted.js` with esbuild.

== Next Steps
See `_grok-step4-roadmap-to-next-release.txt.adoc`.
