= Grok Step 3: Detailed Description of X-Ghosted Userscript

== Overview
- *Name*: Highlight Potential Problems
- *Purpose*: Flags X.com posts with cues and a panel for moderation ease.
- *Version*: Targeting 0.6.1, fixing 0.6.0 rate limits (ref 2ecaf8f49).
- *Target*: `https://x.com/*`, runs at `document-idle`.

== Current State
- *Detection* (`src/utils/identifyPost.js`): PROBLEM (notices/links), POTENTIAL_PROBLEM (replies, depth < 10), GOOD (clean), UNDEFINED (filler, e.g., `/prev/status/123#fillerN`).
- *UI*: Highlights (red/yellow/green/none) in `xGhosted.js`; panel lists PROBLEM/POTENTIAL_PROBLEM links, Copy, theme toggle, Manual Check toggle, persists via `GM_setValue`. CSV export (5s throttle) added; tab checks pending.
- *Tests*: `identifyPosts.test.js` for detection; `xGhosted.test.js` (24 passing); `src/dom/` solid—`createPanel.test.js` fixed.

== End Goal: Version 0.6.1
- *Core*: `xGhosted.js` drives `highlight-potential-problems.js`, IDs set, DOM in `src/dom/`.
- *Features*: Theme sync (done), visuals (done), panel (partial: links/Copy/toggle/CSV/Manual Check done, tab checks/collapsing to refine), eye icon (`👀`) on POTENTIAL_PROBLEM posts, 10s GOOD tab checks pending, 5s-batched collapsing planned, 250ms highlights/5s CSV done, “Manual Check Mode” with `GM_log` done.
- *Tests*: All passing in `xGhosted.test.js` (except collapsing—next).

== How It Works
- *Init*: Sets theme, panel, `MutationObserver`. Loads state (`isPanelVisible`, `isCollapsingEnabled`, `isManualCheckEnabled`, `allPosts`) via `GM_getValue`.
- *Logic*: Scans,ltk highlights, updates panel via `identifyPost.js`, `findReplyingToWithDepth.js`; skips processed posts. Manual checks trigger tab opens. Saves state with `GM_setValue`.
- *State*: Persists visibility, collapsing, manual checks, theme, links, post data.

== Technical Details
- *Files*: `xGhosted.js` (core), `highlight-potential-problems-template.js` (shell), `src/dom/` (DOM logic), `src/utils/` (utils).
- *Depends*: Tampermonkey (`GM_log`, `GM_setValue`, `GM_getValue`), X.com DOM, JSDOM (`resources: 'usable', runScripts: 'dangerously'`).

== Notes
- Adapt to X.com DOM shifts.

- Large updates may hit attachment errors—new prompts if so.
- *History*: 0.5.0 had flat state (no persistence, single highlight), evolved to 0.6.0 with structured `state` and richer features (collapsing, multi-color highlights) but weak testing. 0.6.0’s state handling wins—basis for 0.6.1’s modular, tested `xGhosted.js`, userscript wrapper follows.
- *Lessons Learned March 23, 2025*: UNDEFINED posts in sample (36 posts: 21 GOOD, 1 PROBLEM, 2 POTENTIAL_PROBLEM, 12 UNDEFINED) can lack `<article>`—tests need conditional logic. Test timing: `highlightPosts()` debounce flakes in Jest; use `highlightPostsImmediate()` for reliability. CSV export needs raw responses, AsciiDoc for docs only. Micro-edits cause sync errors—replacement blocks preferred.
- *CRITICAL NOTE March 23, 2025*: Grok MUST follow Step 1 principles and this spec—ignoring them is forbidden. Live input adjusts context, but this framework holds unless I say otherwise. Last warning.
- *Roadmap and Snippets*: Moved to Step 4 to prevent rendering issues.

== Revision History
- March 16, 2025: Planned 0.6.1.
- March 21, 2025: Streamlined, added throttling/debug.
- March 23, 2025: Noted `identifyPost.js` fix, added persistence details. *Updated with 0.5.0 vs. 0.6.0 analysis—0.6.0’s structured state drives 0.6.1’s modular focus.*
- March 22, 2025: Synced IDs, highlights, DOM extraction, 1 failure status.
- March 23, 2025: Fixed `createPanel.test.js`, integrated `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue` for state.
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1—24 tests pass in `xGhosted.test.js`. Beefed up `'highlightPosts applies correct borders'` test—handles UNDEFINED posts with/without `<article>`. Added lessons: UNDEFINED edge cases, test timing fixes.
- March 23, 2025: CSV export (5s throttle) and Manual Check Mode added to `xGhosted.js`, button in `createPanel.js`. Roadmap to 0.6.1 added, moved to Step 4.
- March 24, 2025: Updated to clarify intentions.
