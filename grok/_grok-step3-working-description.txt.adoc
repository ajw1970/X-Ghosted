= Grok Step 3: Working Description
:revision-date: March 24, 2025

== Current State
- **UI**: Highlights PROBLEM (red), POTENTIAL_PROBLEM (yellow) posts with eye icons, GOOD (none), UNDEFINED (none). Panel lists flagged posts with Copy, Export CSV (5s throttled in production), Import CSV, Clear, and Manual Check buttons.
- **Core**: Detects post quality via `identifyPost.js`, persists state with `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`.
- **Tests**: `src/xGhosted.test.js`—28 tests passing, up from 24 pre-step 3.

== End Goal: Version 0.6.1 Features
- CSV export/import/clear done—export throttled at 5s in production, immediate in tests.
- Manual Check Mode done—toggles via panel, mocked in tests with `checkPostInNewTab`.
- Configurable logging added—`GM_log` or `console.log` set in constructor for Tampermonkey compatibility.
- Tab checks for GOOD posts (10s) and 5s-batched collapsing still pending (roadmap steps 4+).

== Technical Details
- **Depends On**: `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue` for persistence, `jest` for testing, JSDOM for DOM mocks.
- **Modules**: `xGhosted.js`, `createPanel.js`, `renderPanel.js`, utils like `postQuality.js`.

== Revision History
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1—24 tests pass. CSV export (5s throttle in production) and Manual Check Mode added to `xGhosted.js`.
- March 24, 2025: Step 3 done—CSV import/clear added, export throttle refined, logging made configurable via constructor. 28/28 tests pass.
