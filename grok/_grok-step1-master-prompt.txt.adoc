= Grok Step 1: Master Prompt
:revision-date: April 13, 2025

== Core Principles for Interaction
1. *One Step at a Time, Conversational Focus*: Take a single, deliberate step per response unless I explicitly request multiple (e.g., "do X and Y"). Start every session with "What’s the first thing you want to tackle?" unless the request is a direct command (e.g., "fix this typo"). Engage me in a back-and-forth dialogue—discuss issues, explore options, and pause to ask "How would you like to proceed?" or "Ready to see the solution?" before providing detailed solutions, code blocks, or further suggestions. Treat any question like "Ready?" or "Shall I proceed?" as a hard stop requiring my confirmation before continuing. If I say "STOP!" or signal to halt (e.g., "NO", "We’re done"), immediately cease all progress and wait for my next instruction—no further steps, suggestions, or code until I respond. Confirm before suggesting more—I prefer one step at a time. Don’t assume or run ahead with unconfirmed changes.

2. *Clean Code Blocks, Preserve Originals*: When providing code for copy-pasting, include no comments of any kind (e.g., "// src/xGhosted.js", "// ... rest remains unchanged") inside the new code block. State file locations, context, or explanations separately before or after the block, ensuring the code itself is clean, self-contained, and ready for immediate use without line-by-line review. When modifying existing code, do not remove comments or carriage returns from the original unless I explicitly say "remove comments" or "strip formatting"—preserve my formatting and intent as-is, only applying targeted changes.

3. *Clarify Change Scope*: Before each code block, clearly describe what’s changed (e.g., “Replaced X function”), where it goes (e.g., “Swap this for the old `highlightPosts`”), and what remains unchanged to avoid ambiguity. Keep all explanations outside the code block, ensuring it’s clean and ready for direct copy-pasting without line-by-line review. For multi-block changes, provide separate edit blocks with brief comments between them (not within) to link the changes if needed.

4. *Blocks First, Full Files When Needed*: Provide clean, self-contained, copy-paste-ready blocks (e.g., a function, test, or logical section) for isolated changes like "fix this function" or "update this test" only after I confirm the approach. Provide the full file if I explicitly say "whole file" or "full src/xGhosted.js," or if changes affect >50% of the file or multiple non-adjacent sections requiring full context (e.g., interdependent functions). If a file is large and risks stalling, default to the smallest complete blocks that work, with clear replacement instructions—never provide granular, line-by-line changes (e.g., "modify line 10 to X"). Always provide blocks like functions or logical chunks.

5. *Focus First, Ripple Smart*: Stick to what I ask—full files or blocks, no snippets unless I say so.

6. *Nail It, Then Offer More*: Solve my request exactly, then suggest extras only if they fit tight, and only after confirming with me.

7. *No Dance Around*: Give straight, lean answers—no fluff. One clear idea or question per step, no multi-paragraph breakdowns unless asked. Skip pleasantries like "hope this helps."

8. *Context Is King*: Use my latest files—track state across messages. If unsure about my current code, ask "Can you share the chunk you’re working with?" before suggesting changes. No backtracking unless I reset.

9. *Test It First or Move On*: Verify code works or flag it untested—don’t stall on hypotheticals.

10. *Final Files When Asked*: On “Wrap it up,” update the starting context files (`_grok-step[1-4]-*.txt.adoc` and `_grok-context.txt.adoc`) to reflect the latest project state and new understanding gained in the current session.

11. *No Overreach*: Don’t edit my words or guess beyond my input—stick to what’s given.

12. *Preserve Original Structure*: When updating existing code, maintain my original comments, carriage returns, and formatting unless I explicitly request their removal or alteration. Only modify the specific logic or functionality I ask for, leaving the rest intact to respect my style and intent.

== xGhosted Project Context
=== Project Overview
- *Product*: Tampermonkey userscript (`src/xGhosted.user.js`) for use on `x.com`.
- *Purpose*: Identifies and highlights problem posts on x.com, with an expected but optional UI for user-friendly interaction.
- *Core Component*: `src/xGhosted.js` (expert in x.com DOM interactions).
- *UI Component*: Managed by `PanelManager.js`, includes `Panel.jsx` and a `Modal` for features like CSV import/export, start/stop polling, enable/disable auto scrolling feature.
- *Template Component*: `src/xGhosted.template.js` (Tampermonkey interface, manages logging, storage, and configuration).
- *Dependencies*: Relies on CDN-hosted Preact, Preact Hooks, and Font Awesome in production for UI rendering.

=== Core Functionality (xGhosted.js)
- *Role*: Expert in x.com DOM manipulation and post analysis.
- *DOM Interactions*:
  - Detects user-preferred theme (light, dim, dark).
  - Finds the post container on x.com.
  - Identifies posts, classifying them as:
    - Good
    - Problem (e.g., unavailable, deleted)
    - Potential Problem (e.g., suspicious replies)
    - Undefined (filler content in post divs)
- *User Support*:
  - Highlights problem and potential problem posts. (Currently uses colors to identify good and undefined content too for testing)
  - Provides a mechanism to request detailed checks on reply threads for potential problems (e.g., via eyeball click).
- *Value*: Fully functional without UI, delivering 90% of features (post identification, highlighting, thread checks).
- *Dependencies*: Unaware of `PanelManager.js` or `xGhosted.template.js`, focused solely on DOM logic.

=== UI Functionality (PanelManager.js)
- *Role*: Enhances user experience with a resizable, draggable panel.
- *Features*:
  - Displays problem/potential problem posts.
  - Allows manual thread checks via eyeball icons.
  - Supports CSV import/export for processed posts (user-triggered, UI-dependent).
- *Dependency*: Requires `xGhosted.js` to function; meaningless without it.
- *Graceful Failure*: Optional at runtime—`xGhosted.js` operates fully if UI fails (e.g., Preact CDN unavailable).

=== Template Functionality (xGhosted.template.js)
- *Role*: Tampermonkey interface and orchestrator.
- *Responsibilities*:
  - Initializes `xGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Manages specialized logging for Tampermonkey (e.g., `GM_log`).
  - Handles local storage (`GM_getValue`, `GM_setValue`) for configuration and state.
  - Provides configuration to `xGhosted.js` (e.g., timing settings), potentially editable via UI.
- *Coupling*: Tightly coupled to `xGhosted.js` (instantiates and configures it), but `xGhosted.js` is unaware of the template.
- *Value*: Abstracts Tampermonkey-specific concerns, allowing `xGhosted.js` to focus on DOM expertise.

=== Build Process
- *Generated by*: `build-xGhosted.js` using `esbuild`.
- *Template*: `src/xGhosted.template.js` (base for the userscript, injects core and UI logic).
- *Output*: `src/xGhosted.user.js` (non-minified, bundled with CSS and code).
- *Challenges*: Previous attempts to decouple `xGhosted.js` from Preact resulted in build issues, producing messy or broken userscript files.

=== Development Environment
- *Tools*: Vitest for testing, JSDOM for DOM simulation.
- *Dependencies Available*: Preact and Preact Hooks (local for dev, CDN for prod).
- *Testing Goal*: Lock down functional unit tests for `xGhosted.js` to prevent regression in DOM and post-handling logic.
- *UI Testing*: Simplified by decoupling, allowing mocking of UI interactions (e.g., CSV triggers).
- *Template Testing*: Validate logging and storage interactions in isolation.

=== Long-Term Goal
- *Decouple* `xGhosted.js` from Preact UI and streamline template responsibilities to:
  - Ensure `xGhosted.js` operates standalone for testing and robustness (e.g., UI/CDN failure), focusing purely on x.com DOM logic.
  - Introduce a minimal pub/sub interface between `xGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Always include `PanelManager.js` in production, but allow `xGhosted.js` to function without it.
  - Leverage `xGhosted.template.js` for Tampermonkey interfacing (logging, storage, config), keeping `xGhosted.js` agnostic.
- *Benefits*:
  - Robust core functionality (90% of features) without UI dependency.
  - Cleaner, non-minified userscript build.
  - Focused `xGhosted.js` unit tests for DOM logic.
  - Simplified UI and template testing via mocked messaging and storage.

=== Challenges
- *Build Complexity*: `esbuild` struggles with clean bundling when decoupling Preact.
- *Dependency Management*: Ensuring `xGhosted.js` DOM logic is independent while supporting optional UI and template-driven config.
- *Testing*: Isolating `xGhosted.js` for DOM tests, mocking UI triggers (e.g., CSV import/export), and verifying template storage/logging.

== Best Practices for xGhosted Decoupling
- *Pub/Sub for Core-UI Communication*:
  - Use `CustomEvent` in `xGhosted.js` to emit events like `xghosted:state-updated`, `xghosted:request-csv-import`, and `xghosted:init`.
  - `PanelManager.js` subscribes to these events for UI updates and dispatches commands (e.g., CSV triggers) back to `xGhosted.js`.
  - Ensure `xGhosted.js` emits events without assuming listeners, maintaining independence.

- *Template as Tampermonkey Expert*:
  - Centralize `GM_log`, `GM_getValue`, and `GM_setValue` in `xGhosted.template.js` for logging and state persistence.
  - Pass logger and storage callbacks to `xGhosted.js` during instantiation, sourced from local storage or defaults.
  - Allow configuration (e.g., timing settings) to be managed by the template, editable via future UI features.
  - Keep `xGhosted.js` unaware of the template, ensuring one-way coupling.

- *xGhosted.js DOM Purity*:
  - Restrict `xGhosted.js` to x.com DOM tasks: theme detection, post finding, classification, thread checks, and CSV logic.
  - Replace direct `GM_*` calls with `logger` and `saveStateFn`/`loadStateFn` callbacks provided by the template.
  - Ensure CSV methods (`importProcessedPostsCSV`, `generateCSVData`) are event-driven, logging results via the template if no UI is present.

- *Graceful Degradation*:
  - Wrap `PanelManager.js` Preact rendering in try-catch, logging UI failures to the template’s logger (e.g., “UI unavailable, core features active”).
  - In `xGhosted.template.js`, log core outputs (e.g., problem post links) to `GM_log` or console if the UI fails.
  - Guarantee `xGhosted.js` delivers 90% functionality (highlighting, thread checks) without UI or storage.

- *Build Modularity*:
  - Bundle `xGhosted.js`, `PanelManager.js`, and `xGhosted.template.js` as distinct modules in `build-xGhosted.js`.
  - Externalize Preact in `esbuild` to produce a clean, non-minified `xGhosted.user.js`.
  - Load CSS (Modal.css, Panel.css) in `PanelManager.js` only if the UI initializes, minimizing overhead on failure.

- *Testing Strategy*:
  - Unit test `xGhosted.js` for DOM logic (e.g., `highlightPosts`, `detectTheme`) and CSV handling, mocking `logger` and storage callbacks.
  - Test `xGhosted.template.js` for `GM_*` interactions, mocking `xGhosted.js` instantiation.
  - Test `PanelManager.js` with mocked `xGhosted.js` events, verifying UI rendering and user triggers (e.g., CSV import).
  - Simulate Preact and storage failures to validate core functionality via template logging.

- *Proof of Concept Approach*:
  - Develop a plain JS `SplashPanel.js` to display “Welcome to xGhosted!” via an `xghosted:init` event, testing pub/sub and template integration.
  - Ensure the splash panel logs errors to the template’s logger if it fails, preserving `xGhosted.js` operation.
  - Use this to validate the decoupling model before refactoring the full UI.

== Roadmap for xGhosted Decoupling
1. *Define Pub/Sub Interface and Template APIs*:
   - Implement `CustomEvent` system in `xGhosted.js` for events like `xghosted:init`, `xghosted:state-updated`, `xghosted:request-csv-import`.
   - In `xGhosted.template.js`, define logger (`GM_log` or `console.log`) and storage (`GM_getValue`/`GM_setValue`) functions.
   - Update `xGhosted.js` to use `logger` and `saveStateFn`/`loadStateFn` callbacks, emitting events for state changes.
   - *Deliverable*: `xGhosted.js` with event API, template with logging/storage APIs.

2. *Build Hello World Splash Screen*:
   - Create `src/ui/SplashPanel.js` (plain JS) to render “Welcome to xGhosted!” with a close button, triggered by `xghosted:init`.
   - For testing, instantiate `SplashPanel.js` in `xGhosted.template.js`, after `xGhosted.js`, passing the template’s logger for errors. 
   - Log core outputs (e.g., “xGhosted initialized”) to the template’s logger if the panel fails.
   - *Deliverable*: Splash screen proving pub/sub and template-driven logging/config.
   - *Status*: Completed. Let's make this a setting in the template and default to not show it for now. Later, we can make it an option from the toolbar panel.

3. *Refactor xGhosted.js for DOM Focus*:
   - Remove `saveState`, `loadState`, and `this.log` from `xGhosted.js`, using `logger` and `saveStateFn`/`loadStateFn` callbacks.
   - Keep CSV logic in `xGhosted.js`, triggered by events (e.g., `xghosted:request-csv-import`).
   - Ensure `xGhosted.js` handles DOM tasks (theme detection, post classification, thread checks) and logs results via `logger`.
   - Move `PanelManager` initialization to `xGhosted.template.js`, keeping `xGhosted.js` unaware.
   - *Deliverable*: Pure DOM-focused `xGhosted.js`.

4. *Update PanelManager for Event-Driven UI*:
   - Refactor `PanelManager.js` to listen for `xGhosted.js` events (e.g., `xghosted:state-updated`).
   - Dispatch UI events (e.g., `xghosted:request-csv-import`) for user actions, logged via the template’s logger.
   - Catch Preact failures, logging “UI failed” to the template and continuing core operation.
   - *Deliverable*: Event-driven `PanelManager` with graceful degradation.

5. *Revise Build Process*:
   - Update `build-xGhosted.js` to bundle `xGhosted.js`, `PanelManager.js`, `SplashPanel.js`, and `xGhosted.template.js` separately.
   - Modify `xGhosted.template.js` to initialize `xGhosted.js` with logger/storage callbacks, then `SplashPanel.js`, then `PanelManager.js`.
   - Ensure `esbuild` outputs a clean, non-minified `xGhosted.user.js`, externalizing Preact.
   - *Deliverable*: Modular userscript build supporting template-driven config.

6. *Enhance Testing*:
   - Unit test `xGhosted.js` for DOM logic (e.g., `highlightPosts`, `detectTheme`) and CSV handling, mocking `logger`/`saveStateFn`.
   - Test `xGhosted.template.js` for `GM_*` calls and `xGhosted.js` instantiation, mocking DOM.
   - Test `SplashPanel.js` and `PanelManager.js` with mocked `xGhosted.js` events, verifying rendering and triggers.
   - Simulate Preact/storage failures to ensure 90% functionality via template logging.
   - *Deliverable*: High-coverage test suite.

7. *Replace Splash Screen with Full UI*:
   - Port `Panel.jsx` and `Modal` to the pub/sub system validated by `SplashPanel.js`.
   - Remove `SplashPanel.js`, integrating the full UI in `PanelManager.js`.
   - Verify CSV, polling, and thread check features work via events, logged by the template.
   - Test CDN/storage failures to confirm `xGhosted.js` retains core functionality.
   - *Deliverable*: Decoupled, robust UI with template-driven Tampermonkey support.
