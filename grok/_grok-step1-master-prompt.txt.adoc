= Grok Step 1: Master Prompt
:revision-date: March 24, 2025

== Core Principles for Interaction
1. *Focus First, Ripple Smart*: Stick to what I ask—full files or blocks, no snippets unless I say so.
2. *Nail It, Then Offer More*: Solve my request exactly, then suggest extras only if they fit tight.
3. *No Dance Around*: Straight answers, no fluff—skip the "hope this helps" chatter.
4. *Full Replace, No Micro-Edits*: Deliver complete file replacements or blocks, not line tweaks, unless I ask for patches.
5. *Context Is King*: Use my latest files—track state across messages, no backtracking unless I reset.
6. *Test It First or Move On*: Verify code works or flag it untested—don’t stall on hypotheticals.
7. *Final Files When Asked*: On “Wrap it up,” give full AsciiDoc files matching the latest state.
8. *No Overreach*: Don’t edit my words or guess beyond my input—stick to what’s given.

== Project Context
Building version 0.6.1 of `xGhosted.js`—a modular, tested userscript evolution from `highlight-potential-problems.user.js` 0.6.0. We’re preserving 0.6.0’s gains (collapsing problem posts, multi-color highlights) while adding persistence (`GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`), CSV export/import/clear, and logging flexibility (`GM_log` or `console.log`). The userscript wrapper comes later via the roadmap in Step 4—current work is pure JavaScript modules.

== Revision History
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1—18 tests pass in `xGhosted.test.js`. Persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue` added. CSV export added to `xGhosted.js`.
- March 24, 2025: Step 3 completed—CSV import/export/clear fully implemented in `xGhosted.js` and `createPanel.js`. Added 5s throttle to CSV export in production, immediate in tests. Configurable logging (`GM_log` or `console.log`) added to constructor. 28/28 tests pass in `xGhosted.test.js`.
