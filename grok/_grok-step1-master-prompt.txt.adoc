= Grok Step 1: Master Prompt
:revision-date: March 27, 2025

== Core Principles for Interaction
1. *Focus First, Ripple Smart*: Stick to what I ask—full files or blocks, no snippets unless I say so.
2. *Nail It, Then Offer More*: Solve my request exactly, then suggest extras only if they fit tight.
3. *No Dance Around*: Straight answers, no fluff—skip the "hope this helps" chatter.
4. *No Micro-Edits*: When asking me to update files, give me complete block replacements, not line tweaks. If the block replacement is within 80% of the total lines, then give me the full file. I don’t want to see any "remaining code" placeholders. Always provide the entire file as a single, copy-paste-ready block, even for small changes, to avoid partial edits or snippets.

Example: This should’ve been two blocks, not one with "[unchanged content...]" placeholder.

= Grok Context for xGhosted Project
:revision-date: March 26, 2025

== Purpose
This file supplements `_grok-step[1-4]` with a snapshot of my (Grok 3, built by xAI) understanding of the xGhosted project as of March 26, 2025. Use it for a quick reference, but rely on `_grok-step[1-4]` for authoritative guidance.

== Project Snapshot
[unchanged content...]

== Code Guidelines
See `_grok-step1-master-prompt.txt.adoc` for full guidelines. Key points: use full blocks or files, state file locations before blocks, ensure copy-paste readiness.

== Next Steps
See `_grok-step4-roadmap-to-next-release.txt.adoc` for current Next Steps.

5. *Context Is King*: Use my latest files—track state across messages, no backtracking unless I reset.
6. *Test It First or Move On*: Verify code works or flag it untested—don’t stall on hypotheticals.
7. *Final Files When Asked*: On “Wrap it up,” give full AsciiDoc files matching the latest state.
8. *No Overreach*: Don’t edit my words or guess beyond my input—stick to what’s given.
9. *Clean Code Blocks*: Don’t add comments like "// In src/xGhosted.js" inside code blocks—state file locations before the block for easy copy-pasting.
10. *No Filename Headers in Code Blocks*: When providing code for the user to copy, do not prepend filename headers (e.g., "// src/dom/createPanel.js") before the code block. State file locations or context separately before the code if needed, ensuring the code itself is clean and ready for immediate copy-pasting.

== Project Context
The pending 0.6.1 release of `xGhosted.js` is in progress—a modular, tested userscript. See `_grok-context.txt.adoc` for the latest snapshot. It preserves 0.6.0’s gains (collapsing problem posts, multi-color highlights) while adding persistence (`GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`), CSV export/import/clear, logging flexibility (`GM_log` or `console.log`), and a 1000-article cap enforced in `identifyPosts`. Hardcoded timing values are configurable via constructor from `xGhosted.template.js`. Step 5 (Userscript Wrapper) uses `build-xGhosted.js` with esbuild to bundle `xGhosted.js` into `xGhosted.user.js`, optimized for minimal X.com server activity (manual mode default, DOM-only analysis). Tests total 112 across 17 suites, all passing. Manual testing of `build-xGhosted.js` output is in progress with `npm run build` confirmed as the correct command. The "Hide" functionality is fixed with proper sizing, but Show/Hide button positioning and POTENTIAL_PROBLEM post detection issues remain. Remaining manual tests include button functionality, 1000-article cap, and eye icon visibility.

== Revision History
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1—18 tests pass in `xGhosted.test.js`. Persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue` added.
- March 24, 2025: Step 5 completed—userscript wrapper with safety optimizations.
- March 25, 2025: Test suite at 24/24 passing in `src/xGhosted.test.js` after fixing timing initialization and `saveState` test. Timing values moved to constructor config, esbuild adopted.
- March 26, 2025: Fixed `build-xGhosted.js` to remove stray ESM `export` statements, ensuring Tampermonkey compatibility. Enforced 1000-article cap in `xGhosted.js`. Fixed "Hide" functionality with proper sizing.
- March 27, 2025: Updated revision date for current review.
