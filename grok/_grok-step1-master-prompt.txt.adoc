= Grok Step 1: Master Prompt
:revision-date: March 29, 2025

== Core Principles for Interaction
1. *Blocks First, Full Files When Asked or Needed*: Provide clean, self-contained, copy-paste-ready blocks (e.g., a function, test, or logical section) for isolated changes like "fix this function" or "update this test." Only give the full file if I explicitly say "whole file" or "full src/xGhosted.js," or if the change spans multiple, scattered parts requiring full context (e.g., interdependent functions). If a file is large and risks stalling, default to the smallest complete blocks that work, with clear replacement instructions—never force me to do line-by-line surgery.
2. *Focus First, Ripple Smart*: Stick to what I ask—full files or blocks, no snippets unless I say so.
3. *Nail It, Then Offer More*: Solve my request exactly, then suggest extras only if they fit tight.
4. *No Dance Around*: Straight answers, no fluff—skip the "hope this helps" chatter.
5. *No Micro-Edits*: When updating, provide complete block replacements or full files, not line tweaks. If the change affects 80% or more of the file, give the entire file as a single, copy-paste-ready block. Always include enough context to avoid partial edits or snippets—never use "remaining code" placeholders.
6. *Context Is King*: Use my latest files—track state across messages, no backtracking unless I reset.
7. *Test It First or Move On*: Verify code works or flag it untested—don’t stall on hypotheticals.
8. *Final Files When Asked*: On “Wrap it up,” update the starting context files (`_grok-step1-master-prompt.txt.adoc` and `_grok-context.txt.adoc`) to reflect the latest project state.
9. *No Overreach*: Don’t edit my words or guess beyond my input—stick to what’s given.
10. *Clean Code Blocks*: Don’t add comments like "// In src/xGhosted.js" inside code blocks—state file locations before the block for easy copy-pasting.
11. *No Filename Headers in Code Blocks*: When providing code for copy-pasting, do not prepend filename headers (e.g., "// src/dom/createPanel.js") before the code block. State file locations or context separately before the code if needed, ensuring the code itself is clean and ready for immediate use.
12. *Clarify Change Scope*: Before each code block, clearly describe what’s changed (e.g., “Replaced X function”), where it goes (e.g., “Swap this for the old `highlightPosts`”), and what remains unchanged to avoid ambiguity. Keep all explanations outside the code block, ensuring it’s clean and ready for direct copy-pasting without line-by-line review.

== Project Context
The pending 0.6.1 release of `xGhosted.js` is in progress—a modular, tested userscript. See `_grok-context.txt.adoc` for the latest snapshot. It preserves 0.6.0’s gains (collapsing problem posts, multi-color highlights) while adding persistence (`GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`), CSV export/import/clear, logging flexibility (`GM_log` or `console.log`), and a 1000-article cap enforced in `identifyPosts`. Hardcoded timing values are configurable via constructor from `xGhosted.template.js`. Step 5 (Userscript Wrapper) uses `build-xGhosted.js` with esbuild to bundle `xGhosted.js` into `xGhosted.user.js`, optimized for minimal X.com server activity (manual mode default, DOM-only analysis). Tests total 112 across 17 suites, all passing. Manual testing of `build-xGhosted.js` output is in progress with `npm run build` confirmed as the correct command.

Persistence of `processedArticles` was removed to fix the 1000-article cap issue and PROBLEM post highlighting, so flagged posts are no longer retained across page reloads. The Show/Hide button overlap with the theme selector is fixed, but the core positioning issue remains: after moving the panel, hiding it reverts to the original position (`top: '60px', right: '10px'`) and collapses toward the top-left instead of the current top-right. PROBLEM posts are now highlighted correctly, and the 1000-article cap message no longer appears prematurely. However, a new issue emerged: the red dot indicating PROBLEM status in the panel is missing for listed posts, likely due to a CSS or class mismatch in `renderPanel.js`. Remaining manual tests include button functionality (Clear/Export CSV state reset), eye icon visibility, and POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection consistency.

== Revision History
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1—18 tests pass in `xGhosted.test.js`. Persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue` added.
- March 24, 2025: Step 5 completed—userscript wrapper with safety optimizations.
- March 25, 2025: Test suite at 24/24 passing in `src/xGhosted.test.js` after fixing timing initialization and `saveState` test. Timing values moved to constructor config, esbuild adopted.
- March 26, 2025: Fixed `build-xGhosted.js` to remove stray ESM `export` statements, ensuring Tampermonkey compatibility. Enforced 1000-article cap in `xGhosted.js`. Fixed "Hide" functionality with proper sizing.
- March 27, 2025: Updated revision date for current review.
- March 28, 2025: Revised Principle 1 to prioritize blocks over full files unless requested, balancing usability and avoiding stalls on large files.
- March 29, 2025: Removed persistence of `processedArticles` to fix 1000-article cap and PROBLEM post highlighting issues. Fixed Show/Hide button overlap with theme selector, but core positioning issue remains unresolved. Noted new issue: missing red dot in panel for PROBLEM posts.
