== Core Principles for Interaction
1. *One Step at a Time, Conversational Focus*: Take a single, deliberate step per response unless I explicitly request multiple (e.g., "do X and Y"). Start every session with "What’s the first thing you want to tackle?" unless the request is a direct command (e.g., "fix this typo"). Engage me in a back-and-forth dialogue—discuss issues, explore options, and pause to ask "How would you like to proceed?" or "Ready to see the solution?" before providing detailed solutions, code blocks, or further suggestions. Treat any question like "Ready?" or "Shall I proceed?" as a hard stop requiring my confirmation before continuing. If I say "STOP!" or signal to halt (e.g., "NO", "We’re done"), immediately cease all progress and wait for my next instruction—no further steps, suggestions, or code until I respond. Confirm before suggesting more—I prefer one step at a time. Don’t assume or run ahead with unconfirmed changes.

2. *Clean Code Blocks, Preserve Originals*: When providing code for copy-pasting, include no comments of any kind (e.g., "// src/xGhosted.js", "// ... rest remains unchanged") inside the new code block. State file locations, context, or explanations separately before or after the block, ensuring the code itself is clean, self-contained, and ready for immediate use without line-by-line review. When modifying existing code, do not remove comments or carriage returns from the original unless I explicitly say "remove comments" or "strip formatting"—preserve my formatting and intent as-is, only applying targeted changes.

3. *Clarify Change Scope*: Before each code block, clearly describe what’s changed (e.g., “Replaced X function”), where it goes (e.g., “Swap this for the old `highlightPosts`”), and what remains unchanged to avoid ambiguity. Keep all explanations outside the code block, ensuring it’s clean and ready for direct copy-pasting without line-by-line review. For multi-block changes, provide separate edit blocks with brief comments between them (not within) to link the changes if needed.

4. *Blocks First, Full Files When Needed*: Provide clean, self-contained, copy-paste-ready blocks (e.g., a function, test, or logical section) for isolated changes like "fix this function" or "update this test" only after I confirm the approach. Provide the full file if I explicitly say "whole file" or "full src/xGhosted.js," or if changes affect >50% of the file or multiple non-adjacent sections requiring full context (e.g., interdependent functions). If a file is large and risks stalling, default to the smallest complete blocks that work, with clear replacement instructions—never provide granular, line-by-line changes (e.g., "modify line 10 to X"). Always provide blocks like functions or logical chunks.

5. *Focus First, Ripple Smart*: Stick to what I ask—full files or blocks, no snippets unless I say so.

6. *Nail It, Then Offer More*: Solve my request exactly, then suggest extras only if they fit tight, and only after confirming with me.

7. *No Dance Around*: Give straight, lean answers—no fluff. One clear idea or question per step, no multi-paragraph breakdowns unless asked. Skip pleasantries like "hope this helps."

8. *Context Is King*: Use my latest files—track state across messages. If unsure about my current code, ask "Can you share the chunk you’re working with?" before suggesting changes. No backtracking unless I reset.

9. *Test It First or Move On*: Verify code works or flag it untested—don’t stall on hypotheticals.

10. *Final Files When Asked*: On “Wrap it up,” update the starting context files (`_grok-step[1-4]-*.txt.adoc` and `_grok-context.txt.adoc`) to reflect the latest project state and new understanding gained in the current session.

11. *No Overreach*: Don’t edit my words or guess beyond my input—stick to what’s given.

12. *Preserve Original Structure*: When updating existing code, maintain my original comments, carriage returns, and formatting unless I explicitly request their removal or alteration. Only modify the specific logic or functionality I ask for, leaving the rest intact to respect my style and intent.

= Grok Step 2: xGhosted Project Context
:revision-date: April 15, 2025

== Project Overview
- *Product*: Tampermonkey userscript (`src/xGhosted.user.js`) for use on `x.com`.
- *Purpose*: Identifies and highlights problem posts on x.com, with an expected but optional UI for user-friendly interaction.
- *Core Component*: `src/xGhosted.js` (expert in x.com DOM interactions).
- *UI Component*: Managed by `PanelManager.js`, includes `Panel.jsx` and a `Modal` for features like CSV import/export, start/stop polling, enable/disable auto scrolling feature.
- *Template Component*: `src/xGhosted.template.js` (Tampermonkey interface, manages logging, storage, and configuration).
- *Dependencies*: Relies on CDN-hosted Preact, Preact Hooks, and Font Awesome in production for UI rendering.

== Core Functionality (xGhosted.js)
- *Role*: Expert in x.com DOM manipulation and post analysis.
- *DOM Interactions*:
  - Detects user-preferred theme (light, dim, dark).
  - Finds the post container on x.com.
  - Identifies posts, classifying them as:
    - Good
    - Problem (e.g., unavailable, deleted)
    - Potential Problem (e.g., suspicious replies)
    - Undefined (filler content in post divs)
- *User Support*:
  - Highlights problem and potential problem posts. (Currently uses colors to identify good and undefined content too for testing)
  - Provides a mechanism to request detailed checks on reply threads for potential problems (e.g., via eyeball click).
- *Value*: Fully functional without UI, delivering 90% of features (post identification, highlighting, thread checks).
- *Dependencies*: Unaware of `PanelManager.js` or `xGhosted.template.js`, focused solely on DOM logic.

== UI Functionality (PanelManager.js)
- *Role*: Enhances user experience with a resizable, draggable panel.
- *Features*:
  - Displays problem/potential problem posts.
  - Allows manual thread checks via eyeball icons.
  - Supports CSV import/export for processed posts (user-triggered, UI-dependent).
- *Dependency*: Requires `xGhosted.js` to function; meaningless without it.
- *Graceful Failure*: Optional at runtime—`xGhosted.js` operates fully if UI fails (e.g., Preact CDN unavailable).

== Template Functionality (xGhosted.template.js)
- *Role*: Tampermonkey interface and orchestrator.
- *Responsibilities*:
  - Initializes `xGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Manages specialized logging for Tampermonkey (e.g., `GM_log`).
  - Handles local storage (`GM_getValue`, `GM_setValue`) for configuration and state.
  - Provides configuration to `xGhosted.js` (e.g., timing settings), potentially editable via UI.
- *Coupling*: Tightly coupled to `xGhosted.js` (instantiates and configures it), but `xGhosted.js` is unaware of the template.
- *Value*: Abstracts Tampermonkey-specific concerns, allowing `xGhosted.js` to focus on DOM expertise.

== Build Process
- *Generated by*: `build-xGhosted.js` using `esbuild`.
- *Template*: `src/xGhosted.template.js` (base for the userscript, injects core and UI logic).
- *Output*: `src/xGhosted.user.js` (non-minified, bundled with CSS and code).
- *Challenges*: Previous attempts to decouple `xGhosted.js` from Preact resulted in build issues, producing messy or broken userscript files.

== Development Environment
- *Tools*: Vitest for testing, JSDOM for DOM simulation.
- *Dependencies Available*: Preact and Preact Hooks (local for dev, CDN for prod).
- *Testing Goal*: Lock down functional unit tests for `xGhosted.js` to prevent regression in DOM and post-handling logic.
- *UI Testing*: Simplified by decoupling, allowing mocking of UI interactions (e.g., CSV triggers).
- *Template Testing*: Validate logging and storage interactions in isolation.

== Long-Term Goal
- *Decouple* `xGhosted.js` from Preact UI and streamline template responsibilities to:
  - Ensure `xGhosted.js` operates standalone for testing and robustness (e.g., UI/CDN failure), focusing purely on x.com DOM logic.
  - Introduce a minimal pub/sub interface between `xGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Always include `PanelManager.js` in production, but allow `xGhosted.js` to function without it.
  - Leverage `xGhosted.template.js` for Tampermonkey interfacing (logging, storage, config), keeping `xGhosted.js` agnostic.
- *Benefits*:
  - Robust core functionality (90% of features) without UI dependency.
  - Cleaner, non-minified userscript build.
  - Focused `xGhosted.js` unit tests for DOM logic.
  - Simplified UI and template testing via mocked messaging and storage.

== Challenges
- *Build Complexity*: `esbuild` struggles with clean bundling when decoupling Preact.
- *Dependency Management*: Ensuring `xGhosted.js` DOM logic is independent while supporting optional UI and template-driven config.
- *Testing*: Isolating `xGhosted.js` for DOM tests, mocking UI triggers (e.g., CSV import/export), and verifying template storage/logging.

= Grok Step 3: xGhosted Decoupling Roadmap
:toc:
:revnumber: 0.3
:revdate: 2025-04-16
:author: Grok 3 (assisting user)

== Overview

Step 1 focuses on decoupling `XGhosted.js` from `PanelManager.js` to ensure `XGhosted.js` handles only DOM-related logic (post highlighting, thread checks) and emits events for state changes, while `xGhosted.template.js` orchestrates instantiation and wiring. The goal is a clean pub/sub interface, with `PanelManager.js` operating independently (like `SplashPanel.js`) and a new `ProcessedPostsManager` service managing shared `processedPosts` state. This step aligns with the initial decoupling phase, minimizing direct dependencies and enabling modular testing.

== Objectives

- Define a pub/sub interface using `CustomEvent` for communication between `XGhosted.js`, `PanelManager.js`, and a new `ProcessedPostsManager`.
- Move UI-specific logic (e.g., CSV handling, panel visibility, position) to `PanelManager.js`.
- Ensure `XGhosted.js` does not import or initialize `PanelManager.js`, relying on `xGhosted.template.js` for setup.
- Detect theme early in `XGhosted.js` and emit `xghosted:theme-detected` for `PanelManager.js` instantiation.
- Introduce `ProcessedPostsManager` to encapsulate `processedPosts`, providing caching and coordination for `XGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
- Update `xGhosted.template.js` to pass logger, storage callbacks, and `ProcessedPostsManager` to components.

== Current State

- `XGhosted.js` handles DOM tasks (highlighting, thread checks), manages `processedPosts` via `ProcessedPostsManager`, and no longer references `PanelManager.js` (removed `this.panelManager`).
- `PanelManager.js` renders the UI, syncs state with `XGhosted.js` via events, and handles drag-and-drop, CSV operations, and theme changes, wired through `xGhosted.template.js`.
- `SplashPanel.js` is decoupled, listening for `xghosted:init` and `xghosted:user-profile-updated` without `XGhosted.js` awareness.
- `processedPosts` is fully managed by `ProcessedPostsManager`, used for caching and CSV operations.
- Theme detection (`detectTheme`) runs early in `XGhosted.js`’s `init`, emitting `xghosted:theme-detected` for `PanelManager.js`.
- `Panel.jsx` dispatches UI events and includes a `useEffect` listener for `xghosted:csv-import` to manage modal state, plus temporary drag listeners (`mousemove`, `mouseup`) in `handleDragStart`.
- Files are stable, with `build-xGhosted.js` producing readable output, no duplicates, and proper injections (`xGhosted.template.js` placeholders).

== Tasks

=== Task 1: Define Pub/Sub Interface in `XGhosted.js`

- **Objective**: Implement a robust event system for `XGhosted.js` to emit state changes without referencing `PanelManager.js`.
- **Actions**:
  - Keep existing `on`, `off`, `emit` methods for internal event handling.
  - Use `CustomEvent` for external events: `xghosted:init`, `xghosted:state-updated`, `xghosted:polling-state-updated`, `xghosted:manual-check-toggled`, `xghosted:auto-scrolling-toggled`, `xghosted:user-profile-updated`.
  - Add new events:
    - `xghosted:theme-detected` for theme detection (emitted early in `init`).
    - `xghosted:posts-updated` for `ProcessedPostsManager` changes (if event-based).
    - `xghosted:request-csv-export` and `xghosted:csv-import` for CSV coordination (to be moved to `PanelManager.js`).
  - Remove UI-specific events: `panel-visibility-toggled`, `panel-position-changed`, `theme-mode-changed`.
  - Remove `PanelManager.js` initialization from `init`.
- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**:
  - Events `xghosted:init`, `xghosted:state-updated`, `xghosted:polling-state-updated`, `xghosted:auto-scrolling-toggled`, `xghosted:theme-detected`, and `xghosted:user-profile-updated` are implemented.
  - Removed redundant events `xghosted:posts-updated`, `xghosted:request-csv-export`, and `xghosted:csv-import` as they are handled by `PanelManager.js`.
  - Replaced `togglePanelVisibility` with `xghosted:toggle-panel-visibility` event, eliminating direct UI method calls.
  - Fixed an event loop in `xghosted:copy-links` by removing redundant dispatch from `PanelManager.js.copyLinks`.
- **Open Questions**: None

=== Task 2: Move Theme Detection to Early Event

- **Objective**: Run `detectTheme` as soon as `doc.body` is available, emitting `xghosted:theme-detected` for `PanelManager.js`.
- **Actions**:
  - In `XGhosted.js`’s `init`:
    - Verify `doc.body` exists (redundant with `xGhosted.template.js`’s check, but safe).
    - Call `getThemeMode` (uses `detectTheme`) and emit `xghosted:theme-detected` with `{ themeMode }`.
    - Move before `findPostContainer` or polling setup.
  - Remove `themeMode` from `XGhosted.js`’s `state` and `saveState`/`loadState`.
  - Update `xGhosted.template.js`:
    - Instantiate `XGhosted.js` and call `init`.
    - Listen for `xghosted:theme-detected` to instantiate `PanelManager.js` with `themeMode`, `logger`, and storage callbacks.
    - Use `{ once: true }` for `xghosted:theme-detected` (single emission).
  - Ensure `detectTheme` runs when `document.readyState !== 'loading'` (likely guaranteed by `document-idle`).
  - Fixed theme selector dropdown in `Panel.jsx` (corrected `_option` typo).
- **Open Questions**:
  - Should `xghosted:theme-detected` re-emit on dynamic theme changes (e.g., x.com theme toggle)? **Resolved: No, deemed unnecessary.**
- **Status**: Complete

=== Task 3: Create `ProcessedPostsManager` Service

- **Objective**: Encapsulate `processedPosts` in a `DbProvider`-like service for caching and coordination.
- **Actions**:
  - Create `ProcessedPostsManager.js` with interface:
    - `hasPost(id)`: Check if post exists.
    - `getPost(id)`: Retrieve post data (`{ analysis, checked }` or null).
    - `registerPost(id, data)`: Add/update post, optionally emit `xghosted:posts-updated`.
    - `getPosts()`: Return all posts (Map or array).
    - `clearPosts()`: Clear posts, emit `xghosted:posts-cleared`.
    - `importPosts(posts)`: Load posts from CSV data (for `PanelManager.js`).
    - `exportPosts()`: Return posts for CSV export.
  - Update `XGhosted.js`:
    - Remove `processedPosts` from `state`.
    - In `highlightPosts`, use `manager.hasPost`/`getPost` for caching, `registerPost` for updates.
    - Update `userRequestedPostCheck` to use `manager.registerPost` for post updates.
  - Update `PanelManager.js`:
    - Listen for `xghosted:posts-updated` to refresh UI.
    - Use `manager.getPosts` for CSV export, `manager.importPosts` for imports.
  - Update `xGhosted.template.js`:
    - Instantiate `ProcessedPostsManager`.
    - Pass manager instance to `XGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Fixed `copyTextToClipboard` access for `copyProblemLinks`.
- **Open Questions**:
  - Should manager handle `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`, or should `xGhosted.template.js` pass storage callbacks? **Resolved: Template passes callbacks.**
  - Should CSV parsing/formatting stay in `PanelManager.js` or move to manager? **Resolved: Stays in `PanelManager.js`.**
  - Should `registerPost` emit per-post events or batch updates (e.g., after `highlightPosts`)? **Resolved: Batch updates.**
- **Status**: Complete

=== Task 4: Move UI Logic to `PanelManager.js`

- **Objective**: Relocate CSV handling and UI state to `PanelManager.js`, making it self-contained.
- **Actions**:
  - Move CSV logic from `XGhosted.js`:
    - Relocate `generateCSVData`, `exportProcessedPostsCSV`, `importProcessedPostsCSV` to `PanelManager.js`.
    - Use `ProcessedPostsManager`’s `getPosts`/`importPosts` for data access.
    - Emit `xghosted:request-csv-export` to request data, handle `xghosted:csv-data` for export.
    - Emit `xghosted:csv-import` with parsed posts.
  - Manage UI state in `PanelManager.js`:
    - Store `isPanelVisible`, `panelPosition`, `themeMode` locally.
    - Add `saveState`/`loadState` using `GM_getValue`/`GM_setValue` (passed from `xGhosted.template.js`).
  - Update event listeners:
    - Listen for `xghosted:init`, `xghosted:state-updated`, `xghosted:polling-state-updated`, `xghosted:manual-check-toggled`, `xghosted:auto-scrolling-toggled`, `xghosted:theme-detected`, `xghosted:posts-updated`.
    - Emit UI actions: `xghosted:start-polling`, `xghosted:stop-polling`, `xghosted:toggle-auto-scrolling`, `xghosted:copy-links`, `xghosted:clear-posts`, `xghosted:toggle-manual-check`, `xghosted:user-post-check`.
  - Add modal closing and alerts for `importProcessedPostsCSV` and `copyProblemLinks`.
- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**:
  - CSV methods and UI state fully moved to `PanelManager.js`.
  - Replaced direct `xGhosted` calls (e.g., `togglePanelVisibility`, `copyLinks`) with events.
  - Implemented modal closing and alerts for CSV import and link copying.
- **Open Questions**: None

=== Task 5: Update `xGhosted.template.js`

- **Objective**: Orchestrate component instantiation and wiring without `XGhosted.js` dependencies.
- **Actions**:
  - Instantiate `ProcessedPostsManager` first.
  - Create `XGhosted.js` with config and logger.
  - Call `XGhosted.js.init()` to start DOM logic.
  - Wait for `xghosted:theme-detected` to instantiate `PanelManager.js` with `themeMode`, `logger`, `GM_getValue`, `GM_setValue`, and `ProcessedPostsManager`.
  - Wire events:
    - Connect `PanelManager.js` actions (`xghosted:start-polling`, etc.) to `XGhosted.js` methods.
    - Handle `xghosted:csv-import`/`xghosted:request-csv-export` via `ProcessedPostsManager`.
  - Keep `SplashPanel.js` instantiation (optional, based on `showSplash`).
  - Use try-catch for `PanelManager.js` to ensure `XGhosted.js` continues on failure.
  - Ensure no duplicate modules (e.g., single `Panel`) and readable output.
- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**:
  - Successfully orchestrates `ProcessedPostsManager`, `XGhosted.js`, and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Wires events (`xghosted:toggle-panel-visibility`, `xghosted:copy-links`, `xghosted:export-csv`, `xghosted:clear-posts`, `xghosted:csv-import`) using a local `panelManager`.
  - Handles `SplashPanel.js` with `showSplash` config and ensures no duplicates.
- **Open Questions**: None

== Decisions

- **Theme Detection**:
  - Run `detectTheme` early in `XGhosted.js`’s `init`, emitting `xghosted:theme-detected` when `doc.body` is available.
  - `xGhosted.template.js` waits for `xghosted:theme-detected` to create `PanelManager.js`.
  - `document.readyState !== 'loading'` assumed safe due to `document-idle`.
  - `themeMode` persisted by `PanelManager.js` in `xGhostedState.themeMode`.
- **ProcessedPostsManager**:
  - Acts as a service with `hasPost`, `getPost`, `registerPost` for caching and updates.
  - Injected into `XGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js` for testability.
  - Supports events (`xghosted:posts-updated`) for UI updates.
  - CSV logic stays in `PanelManager.js`, using manager for data access.
- **Decoupling**:
  - `XGhosted.js` focuses on DOM logic (highlighting, thread checks).
  - `PanelManager.js` handles UI rendering, state, and CSV operations.
  - `xGhosted.template.js` manages instantiation and event wiring, like `SplashPanel.js`.

== Open Questions

- Are test updates needed for `xGhosted.test.js` to cover new events (`xghosted:toggle-panel-visibility`, `xghosted:copy-links`, etc.) and mock `ProcessedPostsManager` interactions post-decoupling?

== Next Steps

- **Priority**: Address open question on test updates for `xGhosted.test.js` if confirmed necessary.
- **Follow-Up**: Review and optimize event listener pattern if centralization is preferred (currently split between module self-wiring and `xGhosted.template.js`).

== Revision History

- April 15, 2025: Completed `themeMode` persistence in `PanelManager.js`, restored `SplashPanel` functionality, updated `xGhosted.template.js` to pass `storage`.
- April 15, 2025: Moved from _grok-step-1-master-prompt.txt.adoc
- April 16, 2025: Fixed theme selector (`_option` typo in `Panel.jsx`), added modal closing and alerts for `importProcessedPostsCSV` and `copyProblemLinks`, stabilized build with `ProcessedPostsManager` integration and no duplicates.
- April 16, 2025: Completed decoupling with `this.panelManager` removal from `XGhosted.js`, fixed `xghosted:copy-links` event loop, added `xghosted:csv-import` listener in `Panel.jsx`.
