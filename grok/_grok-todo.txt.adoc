= Things we'll want to ask Grok to do

* Make sure all UI/UX works

** [x] Test manual check enabled/disabled

** [x] Test open post in new tab when isManualCheckEnabled = false

** [x] Test userRequestedManualCheckInNewTab
*** [x] Works on a reply to a deleted post
*** [x] Need to test on a reply to a good post.
***** [x] We also expect that if a post is verified bad, the tab stays open and the post is highlighted in red along with the indicator on the panel changing to red.

*** [x] I had planned to change the logic on identify posts and the way we handle identification links. It might be time to focus on those.

** [x] Test export csv
** [x] Test import csv
** [x] Test reset csv

* rename isRateLimited to isRateLimitedDetected?

* Add eyeball link column for potential problem posts in the panel
** Test open post in new tab from panel link

* Make sure we can open the old way with the eyeballs if manual check is disabled and panel didn't open.

* Clarify dom for post container and X.com behavior

* Get collapsing feature working as a feature of highlightPosts
** We can use a class to collapse when that is enabled.

* Add unit tests to increase coverage of all but UI/UX stuff.

*MERGE*: collapsing into main

* Switch from HTM to JSX for Preact
* Swtich to TypeScript
* Push list of bad communities and system notice strings into editable data with a default starting set of data.
