= Things we'll want to ask Grok to do

* Make sure all UI/UX works

** Test manual check enabled/disabled
*** Clicking the button when it shows ":On" logs that it toggled off and evidence proves this is correct, but the button doesn't change and still shows ":On". 
*** If I refresh the page, the button shows the new state:Off.

** Test open post in new tab
*** This works when isManualCheckEnabled = false

** Test userRequestedManualCheckInNewTab
*** Works on a reply to a deleted post
*** Need to test on a reply to a good post.

** Test export csv
** Test import csv
** Test reset csv



* rename isRateLimited to isRateLimitedDetected

* Add eyeball link column for potential problem posts in the panel
** Test open post in new tab from panel link

* Make sure we can open the old way with the eyeballs if manual check is disabled

* Clarify dom for post container and X.com behavior

We can get rid of all but processedPosts which can include good posts but have them filtered out of the panel display list by default.
* We can get rid of collapseArticlesWithDelay along with problemLinks and fullyProcessedPosts

* Get collapsing feature working as a feature of highlightPosts
** We can use a class to collapse when that is enabled.

*MERGE*: collapsing into main

* Switch from HTM to JSX for Preact
* Swtich to TypeScript
* Push list of bad communities and system notice strings into editable data with a default starting set of data.
