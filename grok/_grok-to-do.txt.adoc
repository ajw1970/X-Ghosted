= Things we'll want to ask Grok to do

* Can we make src/ui/Components.js smaller without causing problems with src/xGhosted.user.js being minified?
** Maybe the return html stuff can be built from blocks of html files marked up with HTM instead?

* Clarify dom for post container and X.com behavior

* Ensure separation of concerns
** src/xGhosted.js:: Domain logic and app state controller
*** no knowledge of preact/HTM or Tampermonkey
** src/xGhosted.template.js:: Tampermonkey logic
*** CDN for preact/HTM/FontAwesome
** Preact:: UI logic
*** No domain state management.
** xGhosted hands app startup state expectations to preact
** Preact can manage operational UI/UX state

* Push list of bad communities and system notice strings into editable data with a default starting set of data.
