= Grok Step 4: Roadmap to Next Release
:revision-date: March 26, 2025

== Roadmap to Next Version (Post-0.6.0)
1. *Full State Persistence*: Save/load `processedArticles` and settings via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`. Done—24/24 tests passed, `panelPosition` included.
2. *Manual Check Mode*: Toggle via panel, mock tab checks with `checkPostInNewTab`. Done—24/24 tests passed, defaults to enabled.
3. *Manage Processed Posts Data*: Add import/export/clear in CSV format. Export throttle configurable, immediate in tests. Done—functional, CSV tests deferred.
4. *Polish UI/UX*: Refine panel styling (resizable/draggable), theme detection, usability with tooltips. Done—verified in browser, tested in suite.
5. *Userscript Wrapper*: Wrap `xGhosted.js` in a `@userscript` header via `xGhosted.template.js` and `build-xGhosted.js`. Done—uses esbuild, timing configurable, 1000 article cap enforced, manual mode default, DOM-only analysis, ESM exports removed.
6. *Release 0.6.1*: Confirm manual test in Tampermonkey, update `README.md`, and tag release. Pending.

== Roadmap to Next Version Release (0.6.1)
1. *Manual Test Build Script*: Verify `build-xGhosted.js` output in Tampermonkey—ensure bundling, resource caps, manual mode, and no ESM exports. Pending—current task.
2. *Fix Test Suite*: Resolve ESM mocking issues for CSV functionality (`exportProcessedPostsCSV`, `importProcessedPostsCSV`, `clearProcessedPosts`) in `src/xGhosted.csv.test.js`. Target 28/28 passing. Deferred due to `writeToClipboard` mocking issues.
3. *Transition to Rollup*: Replace esbuild with Rollup for bundling, improving maintainability and output readability. Pending post-manual test.
4. *Tab Check GOOD Posts*: Implement 10s interval checks, user-triggered for server safety. Pending.
5. *Performance Pass*: Optimize lookups. Pending.
6. *Collapse by Default*: Batch-collapse problem posts every 5s. Pending.
