= Grok Step 4: Roadmap to Next Release
:revision-date: March 28, 2025

== Roadmap to Next Version Release (0.6.1)
1. *DOM-Driven Detection*: Tag container (`data-xGhosted="posts-container"`, `tabindex="0"`, log `aria-label`), posts (`data-xGhosted="postquality.<quality>"`, `data-xGhosted-id="link"`, `xGhosted-<quality>` classes). Fail with message if not found. Complete—implemented in `xGhosted.js`.
2. *MutationObserver Update*: Watch `[data-xGhosted="posts-container"]` children, re-init on refresh with 5s timeout. DOM-settling check tabled. Complete—implemented in `xGhosted.js`.
3. *Manual Test*: Verify tagging, highlighting, fail message on 50+ post page. Implemented—pending verification.
4. *Deferred Tasks*: Show/Hide fix (done), POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection (resolved via DOM tagging and thread check), Clear/Export CSV reset (done)—shifted below DOM work.
5. *Rate Limit Handling*: Ensure `checkPostInNewTab` handles rate limits by pausing and resuming operations. Complete—verified through tests.

== Next Steps for Continuation
- Verify manual testing for 50+ posts on `/with_replies`.
- Finalize 0.6.1 release with updated documentation.
- Plan enhancements (e.g., auto-collapse toggle, UI refinements).
