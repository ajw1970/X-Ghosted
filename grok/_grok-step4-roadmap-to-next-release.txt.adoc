= Grok Step 4: Roadmap to Next Release (0.6.1)
:revision-date: March 24, 2025

== Roadmap to Version 0.6.1
1. *Full State Persistence*: Save/load `processedArticles` and settings via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`. Done—24/24 tests pass.
2. *Manual Check Mode*: Toggle via panel, mock tab checks with `checkPostInNewTab`. Done—24/24 tests pass, defaults to enabled for safety.
3. *Manage Processed Posts Data*: Add import/export/clear in CSV format. Export 5s throttled in production, immediate in tests. Done—28/28 tests pass.
4. *Polish UI/UX for 0.6.1 Release*: Refine panel styling (resizable/draggable), theme detection, usability with tooltips. Done—untested in test suite.
5. *Userscript Wrapper*: Wrap `xGhosted.js` in a `@userscript` header via `xGhosted.template.js` and build script. Done—optimized for 1000 article cap, 500ms debounce, 1s observer throttle, manual mode default, DOM-only analysis. Build script fixed for method deduplication and Prettier formatting.

== Roadmap to Version 0.6.2
1. *Transition to Rollup*: Replace the custom `build-xGhosted.js` script with Rollup for bundling `xGhosted.js` with its dependencies, improving maintainability and ensuring cleaner, more readable output.
2. *Tab Check GOOD Posts*: 10s interval checks—pending, to be user-triggered for server safety.
3. *Performance Pass*: Optimize lookups—pending.
4. *Collapse by Default*: Batch-collapse problem posts every 5s—pending.
