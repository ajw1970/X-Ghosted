= Grok Step 4: Roadmap to Next Release
:revision-date: March 27, 2025

== Roadmap to Next Version Release (0.6.1)
1. *Manual Test Build Script*: Verify `build-xGhosted.js` output in Tampermonkey—ensure bundling, resource caps, manual mode, and no ESM exports. In progress—panel functionality tested, "Hide" fixed with proper sizing, Show/Hide positioning and POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection pending.
2. *Fix Show/Hide Button Positioning*: Move Show/Hide button to top-right corner of the panel (Issue 2).
3. *Fix POTENTIAL_PROBLEM Detection*: Investigate DOM structure changes or state issues causing inconsistent detection (Issue 3). Highlighting of `/ajweltytest/status/1901080866002014636` fails—check DOM or status assignment.
4. *Complete Manual Testing*:
   - Test remaining button functionality (Copy, Manual Check, Export CSV, Import CSV, Clear).
   - Verify 1000-article cap by loading more posts.
   - Fix eye icon visibility for POTENTIAL_PROBLEM posts (add `zIndex: '10000'`).
5. *Fix Test Suite*: Resolve ESM mocking issues for CSV functionality in `src/xGhosted.csv.test.js`. Current suite at 112/112 passing; CSV tests may increase total if added.
6. *Transition to Rollup*: Replace esbuild with Rollup for bundling, improving maintainability and output readability. Pending post-manual test.
7. *Tab Check GOOD Posts*: Implement 10s interval checks, user-triggered for server safety. Pending.
8. *Performance Pass*: Optimize lookups. Pending.
9. *Collapse by Default*: Batch-collapse problem posts every 5s. Pending.

== Next Steps for Continuation
At the end of the session on March 26, 2025, the following tasks remain unresolved and should be addressed in the next session:
- Verify panel’s position persistence: Confirm it starts at `top: '60px'`, `right: '10px'`, saves position after dragging, and "Hide" button stays fixed during collapse (Issue 2).
- Debug highlighting issue for `/ajweltytest/status/1901080866002014636`: Use console logs to check DOM or status assignment (Issue 3).
- Complete manual testing and fix test suite as outlined in roadmap.
