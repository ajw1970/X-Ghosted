:revision-date: March 24, 2025

== Roadmap to Version 0.6.1
1. *Full State Persistence*: Save/load `processedArticles` and settings via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`. Done—24/24 tests pass.
2. *Manual Check Mode*: Toggle via panel, mock tab checks with `checkPostInNewTab`. Done—24/24 tests pass.

6. *Tab Check GOOD Posts*: 10s interval checks—pending.
