= Grok Step 4: Roadmap to Next Release
:revision-date: March 31, 2025

== Roadmap to Next Version Release (0.6.1)
1. *DOM-Driven Detection*: Tag container (`data-xGhosted="posts-container"`, `tabindex="0"`, log `aria-label`), posts (`data-xGhosted="postquality.<quality>"`, `data-xGhosted-id="link"`, `xGhosted-<quality>` classes). Fail with message if not found. In progress—test on `/with_replies`.
2. *MutationObserver Update*: Watch `[data-xGhosted="posts-container"]` children, re-init on refresh with 5s timeout. DOM-settling check tabled.
3. *Manual Test*: Verify tagging, highlighting, fail message on 50+ post page.
4. *Deferred Tasks*: Show/Hide fix (done), POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection, Clear/Export CSV reset (done)—shifted below DOM work.

== Next Steps for Continuation
- Implement DOM tagging with fail-on-missing in `xGhosted.js`.
- Update observer with 5s timeout, log `aria-label`.
- Test refresh detection and tagging accuracy.
