== Overview
X-Ghosted is a Tampermonkey userscript that flags dodgy X.com posts with visual markers, taming the replies feed. Version 0.6.1 (post commit 2ecaf8f49) nails detection and tests, thanks to a leaner `identifyPost.js`.

== Core Features
- *Detection*: Tags posts as:
  - *Problems*: System notices or target community links (red).
  - *Potential Problems*: Replies to problems, shallow depth (yellow).
  - *Good*: Clean posts (green, post-check).
  - *Undefined*: Filler (collapsible, neutral).
- *UI*: Dynamic highlights and a control panel for flagged links and toggles.
- *Testing*: Unit tests in `identifyPosts.test.js` use real samples from `samples/`.

== Next Steps
- Polish `xGhosted.js` for 0.6.1, driving `highlight-potential-problems.js`.
- Add throttling (debounce) for tab checks and DOM updates; consider user prompts.
- Refine the userscript with a slick panel and auto-collapsing.

== Notes
- Pick up from link:https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted[Grok-Prompt.txt] and latest commit.
- Details in Step 3—keep this lean.

- March 16, 2025: Initial project sketch.
- March 21, 2025: Aligned with 0.6.1, trimmed to essentials.
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1 success—`identifyPost.js` fix aced it.
