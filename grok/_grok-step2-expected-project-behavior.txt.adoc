== Overview
X-Ghosted is a Tampermonkey userscript that flags dodgy X.com posts with visual markers, taming the replies feed. Version 0.6.1 (post commit 2ecaf8f49) nails detection and tests, thanks to a leaner `identifyPost.js`.

== Core Features
- *Detection*: Tags posts as:
  - *Problems*: System notices or target community links (red).
  - *Potential Problems*: Replies to problems, shallow depth (yellow).
  - *Good*: Clean posts (green, post-check).
  - *Undefined*: Filler (collapsible, neutral), tagged with deterministic IDs like `/prev/status/123#fillerN`.
- *UI*: Dynamic highlights (red for Problems, yellow for Potential Problems with eye icon, green for Good post-check, none for Undefined) implemented; control panel from 0.6.0 integrated with PROBLEM/POTENTIAL links, Copy button, and theme toggle; full panel features (CSV, collapse toggles) in progress.
- *Testing*: Unit tests in `identifyPosts.test.js` use real samples from `samples/`; `xGhosted.test.js` covers integration, with `init sets up panel and highlights` fixed using `highlightPostsImmediate()`; DOM unit tests in `src/dom/` added for panel functions; 1 failure remains in `identifyPosts classifies posts and caches results`.

== Next Steps
- Un-skip most tests in `xGhosted.test.js` (except collapsing-related) to lock in 0.6.1 integration coverage.
- Finalize panel with CSV writes (5s throttle) and tab checks (2s-debounced for GOOD highlights); leave collapsing for last.
- Add user prompts for “Manual Check Mode” if debug kicks in.
- Fix `identifyPosts classifies posts and caches results`—expects `processedArticles.size` 0 but gets 36 after `highlightPostsImmediate()`; check size before population.

== Notes
- Pick up from link:https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted[Grok-Prompt.txt] and latest commit.
- Details in Step 3—keep this lean.
- Large updates may hit attachment errors; start new prompts if needed.

== Revision History
- March 16, 2025: Initial project sketch.
- March 21, 2025: Aligned with 0.6.1, trimmed to essentials.
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1 success—`identifyPost.js` fix aced it.
- March 22, 2025: Updated for `identifyPosts()` deterministic IDs—fillers now trackable; added highlights implementation; shifted next steps to collapsing and panel; integrated 0.6.0 panel, began DOM extraction to `src/dom/`, noted test failures and attachment issues; updated status: 1 failure remains.
- March 23, 2025: Noted `xGhosted.test.js` fix—`init sets up panel and highlights` passes; next step is un-skipping tests, delaying collapsing; status as of March 23, 2025: 1 failure in `identifyPosts classifies posts and caches results`.
