== Overview
X-Ghosted, a Tampermonkey userscript, flags sketchy X.com posts with visual cues, wrangling the replies feed. Version 0.6.1 (post commit 2ecaf8f49) sharpens detection and tests, powered by a lean `identifyPost.js`, with state persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`.

== Core Features
- *Detection*: Tags posts:
  - *Problems*: Notices or bad community links (red).
  - *Potential Problems*: Shallow-depth replies to issues (yellow).
  - *Good*: Clean posts (green post-check).
  - *Undefined*: Filler, deterministic IDs (e.g., `/prev/status/123#fillerN`).
- *UI*: Highlights (red/yellow/green/none) in `xGhosted.js`; 0.6.0 panel with PROBLEM/POTENTIAL links, Copy button, theme toggle—all live. Start/Stop/Reset collapsing controls persist via `GM_setValue`. CSV and tab checks in progress.
- *Testing*: `identifyPosts.test.js` nails detection (7 redundant skips flagged); `xGhosted.test.js` locks integration; `src/dom/` tests (e.g., `createPanel.test.js` fixed) solid—all passing as of March 23, 2025.

== Next Steps
- Cut 7 redundant tests from `identifyPosts.test.js`—overkill covered elsewhere.
- Finalize panel: CSV (5s throttle), tab checks (2s-debounced GOOD updates).
- Add “Manual Check Mode” toggle with `GM_log` for flagged posts, persisting state.

== Notes
- Resume via link:https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted[Grok-Prompt.txt], latest commit.
- Details in Step 3—keep this tight.
- Large updates might hit attachment snags—new prompts if needed.
- *History*: 0.5.0 had flat state (e.g., `processedArticles`, `problemLinks`), single yellow highlight, no persistence. 0.6.0 introduced `state` object, richer features (collapsing, multi-color highlights), but light testing. 0.6.0’s structure wins—basis for 0.6.1’s modular, tested `xGhosted.js`, with userscript wrapper later.
- *Lesson Learned March 23, 2025*: Sample HTML (36 posts: 21 GOOD, 1 PROBLEM, 2 POTENTIAL, 12 UNDEFINED) is key for validating counts—e.g., CSV export should match 3 flagged posts.

== Revision History
- March 16, 2025: Initial sketch.
- March 21, 2025: Aligned with 0.6.1, trimmed.
- March 23, 2025: Noted `identifyPost.js` fix success, added state persistence details. *Updated with 0.5.0 vs. 0.6.0 analysis—0.6.0’s structured state drives 0.6.1’s modular evolution.*
- March 22, 2025: Added deterministic IDs, highlights, DOM extraction, 1 failure status.
- March 23, 2025: Updated for `createPanel.test.js` fix, 7 redundant tests in `identifyPosts.test.js` to cut, rules shifted to principles after today’s win. Persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue` integrated.
- March 23, 2025: Updated for 0.6.1—18 tests pass in `xGhosted.test.js`. Beefed up `'highlightPosts applies correct borders'` test—handles UNDEFINED posts without `<article>`. Next: CSV export (5s throttle). Added lesson: sample data specificity guides feature validation.
