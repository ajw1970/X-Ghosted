== Overview
X-Ghosted, a Tampermonkey userscript, flags sketchy X.com posts with visual cues, wrangling the replies feed. Version 0.6.1 (post commit 2ecaf8f49) sharpens detection and tests, powered by a lean `identifyPost.js`.

== Core Features
- *Detection*: Tags posts:
  - *Problems*: Notices or bad community links (red).
  - *Potential Problems*: Shallow-depth replies to issues (yellow).
  - *Good*: Clean posts (green post-check).
  - *Undefined*: Filler, deterministic IDs (e.g., `/prev/status/123#fillerN`).
- *UI*: Highlights (red/yellow/green/none) in `xGhosted.js`; 0.6.0 panel with PROBLEM/POTENTIAL links, Copy button, theme toggle—all live. CSV and collapse toggles in progress.
- *Testing*: `identifyPosts.test.js` nails detection with `samples/` (7 redundant skips flagged); `xGhosted.test.js` locks integration; `src/dom/` tests (e.g., `createPanel.test.js` fixed) solid.

== Next Steps
- Cut 7 redundant skipped tests from `identifyPosts.test.js`—overkill covered elsewhere.
- Un-skip `xGhosted.test.js` tests (e.g., `'highlightPosts applies correct borders'`) for 0.6.1 coverage, save collapsing for last.
- Finalize panel: CSV (5s throttle), tab checks (2s-debounced GOOD updates).
- Add “Manual Check Mode” prompts if debug calls.

== Notes
- Resume via link:https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted[Grok-Prompt.txt], latest commit.
- Details in Step 3—keep this tight.
- Large updates might hit attachment snags—new prompts if needed.
- March 23, 2025: Rules loosened to principles—worked slick today, fixed `createPanel.test.js`, eyed test cleanup.

== Revision History
- March 16, 2025: Initial sketch.

- March 22, 2025: Added deterministic IDs, highlights, DOM extraction, 1 failure status.
- March 23, 2025: Updated for `createPanel.test.js` fix, 7 redundant tests in `identifyPosts.test.js` to cut, rules shifted to principles after today’s win.
