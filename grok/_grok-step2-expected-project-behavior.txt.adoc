== Overview
X-Ghosted is a Tampermonkey userscript that flags dodgy posts on X.com with visual markers, making the replies feed less of a minefield. Version 0.6.1 aims to refine 0.6.0 (commit 2ecaf8f49) with better throttling and polish.

== Core Features
- *Detection*: Tags posts as:
  - *Problems*: System notices or target community links (red).
  - *Potential Problems*: Replies to problems, shallow depth (yellow).
  - *Good*: Clean posts (green, post-check).
  - *Undefined*: Filler (collapsible, neutral).
- *UI*: Dynamic highlights and a control panel for flagged links and toggles.
- *Testing*: Unit tests in `identifyPosts.test.js` use real samples from `samples/`.

== Next Steps
- Craft `xGhosted.js` as the 0.6.1 core, driving `highlight-potential-problems.js`.
- Throttle tab checks and DOM updates (e.g., debounce), maybe with user prompts.
- Streamline to a slick userscript with a polished panel and auto-collapsing.

== Notes
- Pick up from link:https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted[Grok-Prompt.txt] and latest commit.
- Details in Step 3â€”keep this lean.

- March 21, 2025: Aligned with 0.6.1, trimmed to essentials.
