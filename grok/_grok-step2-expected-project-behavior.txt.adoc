= Grok Step 2: Expected Project Behavior
:revision-date: March 28, 2025

== Core Features in Current State
- *Detection*: Highlights PROBLEM (red), POTENTIAL_PROBLEM (yellow, with eye icons), GOOD (none), UNDEFINED (none) posts on X’s `/with_replies` pages using DOM attributes. Container tagged with `data-xGhosted="posts-container"` (scoped to `tabindex="0"`), posts tagged with `data-xGhosted="postquality.<quality>"` and `data-xGhosted-id="link"`, styled via CSS classes (`xGhosted-<quality>`). Fails with message if container’s missing. POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection uses `checkPostInNewTab` for thread analysis, throttled in `highlightPosts`. Rate limit handling in `checkPostInNewTab` pauses and resumes operations seamlessly, validated through test cases.
- *UI*: Floating panel (resizable, draggable) lists problem/potential posts with Copy, Export CSV, Import CSV, Clear, and Manual Check buttons. Theme switching seamless. Highlights via `[data-xGhosted="posts-container"] .xGhosted-<quality>`. Show/Hide fixed—collapses top-right.
- *Persistence*: State saved via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`—includes `processedArticles` (capped at 1000), settings, and panel position. `processedPosts` persistence optional via `persistProcessedPosts`.
- *Logging*: Configurable via constructor—`GM_log` or `console.log`.
- *Safety*: Starts with `isManualCheckEnabled` true; debounce/throttle configurable; 1000-article cap enforced.
- *Observer*: Watches `[data-xGhosted="posts-container"]` children, re-inits on refresh with 5s timeout.
- *Tests*: All 74 tests across 17 suites passing, covering DOM tagging, class-based highlighting, and rate limit scenarios.
- *Build*: Esbuild bundles `xGhosted.js` into `xGhosted.user.js`—run via `npm run build`.

== Next Steps
Verify manual testing for 50+ posts on `/with_replies`, finalize documentation, and prepare for release.
