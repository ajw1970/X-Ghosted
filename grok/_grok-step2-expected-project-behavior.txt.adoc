== Overview
X-Ghosted is a Tampermonkey userscript that flags dodgy X.com posts with visual markers, taming the replies feed. Version 0.6.1 (post commit 2ecaf8f49) nails detection and tests, thanks to a leaner `identifyPost.js`.

== Core Features
- *Detection*: Tags posts as:
  - *Problems*: System notices or target community links (red).
  - *Potential Problems*: Replies to problems, shallow depth (yellow).
  - *Good*: Clean posts (green, post-check).
  - *Undefined*: Filler (collapsible, neutral), tagged with deterministic IDs like `/prev/status/123#fillerN`.
- *UI*: Dynamic highlights (red for Problems, yellow for Potential Problems with eye icon, green for Good post-check, none for Undefined) implemented; control panel from 0.6.0 integrated with PROBLEM/POTENTIAL links, Copy button, and theme toggle; full panel features (CSV, collapse toggles) in progress.
- *Testing*: Unit tests in `identifyPosts.test.js` use real samples from `samples/`; `xGhosted.test.js` covers integration; DOM unit tests in `src/dom/` added for panel functions.

== Next Steps
- Finalize `xGhosted.js` for 0.6.1 by completing panel (CSV writes with 5s throttle, auto-collapse toggles) and tab checks (2s-debounced for GOOD highlights).
- Add user prompts for “Manual Check Mode” if debug kicks in.
- Resolve DOM unit test failures: RGB color normalization in `createButton`, config passing in `createPanel`, flagged post rendering in `renderPanel`.

== Notes
- Pick up from link:https://github.com/ajw1970/X-Ghosted[Grok-Prompt.txt] and latest commit.
- Details in Step 3—keep this lean.
- Large updates may hit attachment errors; start new prompts if needed.
