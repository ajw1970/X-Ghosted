= Grok Step 2: Expected Project Behavior
:revision-date: March 24, 2025

== Core Features in Current State
- **Detection**: Highlights PROBLEM (red), POTENTIAL_PROBLEM (yellow), GOOD (green), UNDEFINED (none) posts on X’s `/with_replies` pages.
- **UI**: Floating panel lists problem/potential posts with Copy, Export CSV (5s throttled in production), Import CSV, Clear, and Manual Check buttons.
- **Persistence**: State saved via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`—loads/saves `processedArticles` and settings.
- **Logging**: Configurable via constructor—uses `GM_log` for Tampermonkey or `console.log` otherwise.
- **Tests**: 28/28 passing in `src/xGhosted.test.js`, covering CSV management, persistence, and core functionality.

== Next Steps
Follow the roadmap in Step 4—UI polish for 0.6.1 release is next, then userscript wrapper and beyond.

== Revision History
- March 23, 2025: Step 2 completed—24/24 tests pass in `xGhosted.test.js` with Manual Check Mode added via `checkPostInNewTab` mocks. CSV export added to `xGhosted.js`.
- March 24, 2025: Step 3 completed—CSV import and clear added to `xGhosted.js` and `createPanel.js`. Export throttle set to 5s in production, immediate in tests. Logging made configurable. 28/28 tests pass.

== Notes
Large updates might hit X post size limits—Grok will flag truncation if detected and pause for new prompts.
