= Grok Step 2: xGhosted Project Context
:revision-date: April 15, 2025

== Project Overview
- *Product*: Tampermonkey userscript (`src/xGhosted.user.js`) for use on `x.com`.
- *Purpose*: Identifies and highlights problem posts on x.com, with an expected but optional UI for user-friendly interaction.
- *Core Component*: `src/xGhosted.js` (expert in x.com DOM interactions).
- *UI Component*: Managed by `PanelManager.js`, includes `Panel.jsx` and a `Modal` for features like CSV import/export, start/stop processing, enable/disable auto scrolling feature.
- *Template Component*: `src/xGhosted.template.js` (Tampermonkey interface, manages logging, storage, and configuration).
- *Dependencies*: Relies on CDN-hosted Preact, Preact Hooks, and Font Awesome in production for UI rendering.

== Core Functionality (xGhosted.js)
- *Role*: Expert in x.com DOM manipulation and post analysis.
- *DOM Interactions*:
  - Detects user-preferred theme (light, dim, dark).
  - Finds the post container on x.com.
  - Identifies posts, classifying them as:
    - Good
    - Problem (e.g., unavailable, deleted)
    - Potential Problem (e.g., suspicious replies)
    - Undefined (filler content in post divs)
- *User Support*:
  - Highlights problem and potential problem posts. (Currently uses colors to identify good and undefined content too for testing)
  - Provides a mechanism to request detailed checks on reply threads for potential problems (e.g., via eyeball click).
- *Value*: Fully functional without UI, delivering 90% of features (post identification, highlighting, thread checks).
- *Dependencies*: Unaware of `PanelManager.js` or `xGhosted.template.js`, focused solely on DOM logic.

== UI Functionality (PanelManager.js)
- *Role*: Enhances user experience with a resizable, draggable panel.
- *Features*:
  - Displays problem/potential problem posts.
  - Allows manual thread checks via eyeball icons.
  - Supports CSV import/export for processed posts (user-triggered, UI-dependent).
  - Manages splash screen display with `hasSeenSplash` state, showing it only on first load unless triggered via an "About" button in the Tools panel (implemented April 18, 2025).
- *Dependency*: Requires `xGhosted.js` to function; meaningless without it.
- *Graceful Failure*: Optional at runtimeâ€”`xGhosted.js` operates fully if UI fails (e.g., Preact CDN unavailable).

== Template Functionality (xGhosted.template.js)
- *Role*: Tampermonkey interface and orchestrator.
- *Responsibilities*:
  - Initializes `xGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Manages specialized logging for Tampermonkey (e.g., `GM_log`).
  - Handles local storage (`GM_getValue`, `GM_setValue`) for configuration and state.
  - Provides configuration to `xGhosted.js` (e.g., timing settings), potentially editable via UI.
- *Coupling*: Tightly coupled to `xGhosted.js` (instantiates and configures it), but `xGhosted.js` is unaware of the template.
- *Value*: Abstracts Tampermonkey-specific concerns, allowing `xGhosted.js` to focus on DOM expertise.

== Build Process
- *Generated by*: `build-xGhosted.js` using `esbuild`.
- *Template*: `src/xGhosted.template.js` (base for the userscript, injects core and UI logic).
- *Output*: `src/xGhosted.user.js` (non-minified, bundled with CSS and code).
- *Challenges*: Previous attempts to decouple `xGhosted.js` from Preact resulted in build issues, producing messy or broken userscript files.

== Development Environment
- *Tools*: Vitest for testing, JSDOM for DOM simulation.
- *Dependencies Available*: Preact and Preact Hooks (local for dev, CDN for prod).
- *Testing Goal*: Lock down functional unit tests for `xGhosted.js` to prevent regression in DOM and post-handling logic.
- *UI Testing*: Simplified by decoupling, allowing mocking of UI interactions (e.g., CSV triggers).
- *Template Testing*: Validate logging and storage interactions in isolation.

== Long-Term Goal
- *Decouple* `xGhosted.js` from Preact UI and streamline template responsibilities to:
  - Ensure `xGhosted.js` operates standalone for testing and robustness (e.g., UI/CDN failure), focusing purely on x.com DOM logic.
  - Introduce a minimal pub/sub interface between `xGhosted.js` and `PanelManager.js`.
  - Always include `PanelManager.js` in production, but allow `xGhosted.js` to function without it.
  - Leverage `xGhosted.template.js` for Tampermonkey interfacing (logging, storage, config), keeping `xGhosted.js` agnostic.
- *Progress*: On April 18, 2025, decoupled `toggleAutoScrolling` in `Panel.jsx` by replacing direct `xGhosted.toggleAutoScrolling()` calls with a `xghosted:set-auto-scrolling` event, reducing UI dependency on `XGhosted.js` and advancing the pub/sub interface.
- *Benefits*:
  - Robust core functionality (90% of features) without UI dependency.
  - Cleaner, non-minified userscript build.
  - Focused `xGhosted.js` unit tests for DOM logic.
  - Simplified UI and template testing via mocked messaging and storage.

== Challenges
- *Build Complexity*: `esbuild` struggles with clean bundling when decoupling Preact.
- *Dependency Management*: Ensuring `xGhosted.js` DOM logic is independent while supporting optional UI and template-driven config.
- *Testing*: Isolating `xGhosted.js` for DOM tests, mocking UI triggers (e.g., CSV import/export), and verifying template storage/logging.

== Revision History
- April 18, 2025: Updated Long-Term Goal to note decoupling of `toggleAutoScrolling` with `xghosted:set-auto-scrolling` event; added splash screen management to UI Functionality features in `PanelManager.js`.
