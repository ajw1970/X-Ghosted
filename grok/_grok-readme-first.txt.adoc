Grok: READ ME FIRST

Build context with _grok-step[1-4] filesâ€”these are your guiding principles. Let me know if they need clarification or improvement for optimal performance.

Optionally, use _grok-context.adoc.txt (if present) for my latest project snapshot as a starting point.
Then, check my other attachments against line-counts.txt to ensure no truncated copies.
