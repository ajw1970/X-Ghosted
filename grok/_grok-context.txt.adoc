= Grok Context for xGhosted Project
:revision-date: March 26, 2025

== Purpose
This file supplements `_grok-step[1-4]` with a snapshot of my (Grok 3, built by xAI) understanding of the xGhosted project as of March 26, 2025. Use it for a quick reference, but rely on `_grok-step[1-4]` for authoritative guidance.

== Project Snapshot
Assisting with xGhosted at version 0.6.1, a Tampermonkey userscript (`xGhosted.user.js`) built from `xGhosted.js` and dependencies via `build-xGhosted.js` using esbuild. Key features include DOM-only post analysis (PROBLEM: red, POTENTIAL_PROBLEM: yellow, GOOD/UNDEFINED: none), a resizable/draggable panel with CSV export/import/clear, and persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`. The panel now includes a "Tools" section (collapsible, with Copy, Export CSV, Import CSV, Clear, and Manual Check buttons), a modal for CSV import, status dots for posts, and SVG icons for buttons, integrated from the 0.6.4 UI/UX design. Safeguards include a 1000-article cap enforced in `identifyPosts`, manual mode default (`isManualCheckEnabled = true`), configurable timing (debounce/throttle), and minimal server activity (tab checks throttled at 5000ms). The build script removes ESM exports for compatibility, and `npm run build` (not `npm build`) is the correct command due to npm’s script conventions. Tests (112 across 17 suites) cover core functionality, with CSV tests pending due to ESM mocking issues. Manual testing in progress: "Hide" functionality fixed with proper sizing and position persistence (panel starts at `top: '60px'`, `right: '10px'`, saves position after dragging), but the "Hide" button’s screen position during collapse and highlighting of the problem post `/ajweltytest/status/1901080866002014636` are pending. Remaining manual tests include button functionality (Copy, Manual Check, Export CSV, Import CSV, Clear), 1000-article cap verification, and eye icon visibility fix.

== Code Guidelines
See `_grok-step1-master-prompt.txt.adoc` for full guidelines. Key points: use full blocks or files, state file locations before blocks, ensure copy-paste readiness.
