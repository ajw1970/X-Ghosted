= Grok Context for xGhosted v0.6.1
:revision-date: March 30, 2025

== Roadmap to 0.6.1 Release
- [x] Fix Show/Hide positioning and collapse behavior (Issue 2: After moving the panel, hiding it reverts to original position and collapses toward top-left; expected to collapse to current top-right). Resolved: Panel now collapses to current top-right position, button stays stationary.
- [x] Resolve PROBLEM post highlighting (Issue 3: PROBLEM posts appear in panel with red dot but lack red highlight in UI). Resolved: PROBLEM posts now highlighted via `xGhosted-problem` class in UI.
- [x] Ensure Clear button fully resets state for Export CSV (Issue 4: After clearing posts, Export CSV still outputs the previous list, indicating an incomplete state reset). Resolved: Clear button now fully resets state, Export CSV reflects cleared state.
- [x] Fix POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection inconsistencies (Issue 5: POTENTIAL_PROBLEM posts not consistently detected in manual testing despite test success). Resolved: Implemented DOM tagging with `data-xGhosted="postquality.potential_problem"` and CSS class `xGhosted-potential_problem`, with `checkPostInNewTab` verifying threads.
- [x] Fix missing red dot in panel for PROBLEM posts (Issue 7: Red dot indicating PROBLEM status is missing in the panel, likely due to CSS or class mismatch in `renderPanel.js`). Resolved: Fixed class name to `status-problem` in `renderPanel.js`.
- [x] Resolve rate limit test failure in `xGhosted.test.js` (Issue 8: Test timed out due to improper handling of timers and `done()` callback). Resolved: Rewrote test using `async/await` and advanced timers correctly.
- [x] Remove `createPanel` import from `src/xGhosted.js` (March 30, 2025): Resolved build error (`Could not resolve "./dom/createPanel"`) by removing `import { createPanel } from './dom/createPanel'`. `npm run build` now generates a clean `xGhosted.user.js`.
- [ ] Implement Preact-based UI/UX with HTM and CDN loading for a modular and clean userscript. See Goals for xGhosted UI/UX Enhancement below.

== Manual Testing
- [ ] Verify tagging, highlighting, and fail message on 50+ post page.
- [ ] Test rate limit handling and confirm UI updates (e.g., status dots) during pause and resume.

== Preact/HTM Isolation for Production and Testing

=== Objective
Enable `src/xGhosted.js` to use a Preact-based `Panel` component (from `src/ui/Components.js`) in production via CDN-loaded Preact/HTM globals, while allowing tests to use local Preact/HTM modules without CDN or mocking, maintaining a clean `src/xGhosted.user.js` with no bundled Preact/HTM dependencies.

=== Production Rules
- Use `window.preact` (e.g., `window.preact.h`, `window.preact.render`) and `window.htm` globals in `src/xGhosted.js` and `src/ui/Components.js`, provided by `@require` directives in `src/xGhosted.template.js` (e.g., `@require https://unpkg.com/preact@10.26.4/dist/preact.min.js`).
- Define components like `window.Panel` in `src/ui/Components.js` using these globals, not local imports.
- Import `src/ui/Components.js` in `src/xGhosted.js` via ESM (e.g., `import './ui/Components.js';`) to bundle it with `build-xGhosted.js`, ensuring `window.Panel` is available.
- Call `window.preact.render` directly in `src/xGhosted.js` (e.g., in `XGhosted.prototype.createPanel`)—no intermediate wrappers.

=== Testing Rules
- In test files (e.g., `src/xGhosted.test.js`), import Preact/HTM directly from `node_modules` (e.g., `import { h, render } from 'preact'; import htm from 'htm';`)—installed via `npm install --save-dev preact htm`.
- Assume no CDN globals (`window.preact`, `window.htm`) exist in tests; use local modules instead.
- Avoid mocking Preact/HTM in Vitest—use the real implementations for accurate testing.

=== Isolation Mechanism
- Production code (`src/xGhosted.js`, `src/ui/Components.js`) uses `window.preact` and `window.htm` globals, set by CDN in `src/xGhosted.template.js`.
- Tests bridge the gap by setting `window.preact` and `window.htm` to local modules before running production code, via a preamble in `jest.setup.mjs`:

[source,javascript]
----
import { h, render } from 'preact';
import htm from 'htm';
global.window = global.window || {};
window.preact = { h, render };
window.htm = htm.bind(h);
----

- This ensures production code runs unchanged in tests, with `window.Panel` and rendering working as in production, but using local Preact/HTM.

=== Build Process
- `build-xGhosted.js` bundles `src/xGhosted.js` and its ESM imports (e.g., `src/ui/Components.js`) into `src/xGhosted.user.js`, injecting them at `// INJECT: xGhosted`.
- Preact/HTM are not bundled—loaded via CDN `@require` in `src/xGhosted.template.js`.
- No production code changes for testing—isolation is handled in `jest.setup.mjs`.

=== Why No Wrapper?
- A wrapper (e.g., `src/ui/wrapper.js`) is not required for production—`src/xGhosted.js` can call `window.preact.render` and `window.Panel` directly, keeping it simple.
- Wrappers were a past mistake for test isolation; instead, use the `jest.setup.mjs` preamble to align test and production environments without altering production code.

== Goals for xGhosted UI/UX Enhancement

=== Overview
You want to improve the UI/UX for your project (`src/xGhosted.js`) while keeping the final userscript (`src/xGhosted.user.js`) clean and free of direct dependencies on Preact or HTM. You prefer a methodical, conversational approach to this transition, taking one step at a time with clear discussion and confirmation at each stage.

=== Replace UI/UX with Preact and HTM
- Use Preact with HTM (instead of JSX) for simplicity in your UI/UX components.
- Keep the final `src/xGhosted.user.js` lightweight and unmodified by loading Preact and HTM from a CDN.

=== Modularity and Cleanliness
- Extract UI/UX logic and styles from `src/xGhosted.js` into separate ES6 modules (e.g., under `src/utils/` or `src/ui/`).
- Ensure the production code (`src/xGhosted.js`) doesn’t directly depend on Preact or HTM.

=== Testing with Vitest
- Use Preact and HTM in unit tests without mocking them, leveraging Vitest (since you’re committed to ES6 and ESBuild).
- Introduce a wrapper (`src/utils/wrapper.js`) to bridge the gap between tests (which use Preact/HTM) and production code (which avoids direct Preact/HTM imports)—if needed, after discussion.

=== Build Process
- Use ESBuild to generate `src/xGhosted.user.js` in a straightforward way, relying on a CDN for Preact and HTM in production, keeping the bundled code pure.

=== CDN Dependency
- Load Preact (and potentially HTM) from a CDN in `src/xGhosted.template.js`, ensuring the end product (`src/xGhosted.user.js`) has no bundled Preact/HTM code.
