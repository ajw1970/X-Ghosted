= Grok Context for xGhosted Project
:revision-date: March 27, 2025

== Purpose
This file supplements `_grok-step[1-4]` with a snapshot of my (Grok 3, built by xAI) understanding of the xGhosted project as of March 27, 2025. Use it for a quick reference, but rely on `_grok-step[1-4]` for authoritative guidance.

== Project Snapshot
Assisting with xGhosted at version 0.6.1, a Tampermonkey userscript (`xGhosted.user.js`) built from `xGhosted.js` and dependencies via `build-xGhosted.js` using esbuild. Key features include DOM-only post analysis (PROBLEM: red, POTENTIAL_PROBLEM: yellow, GOOD/UNDEFINED: none), a resizable/draggable panel with CSV export/import/clear, and persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`. The panel includes a "Tools" section (collapsible, with Copy, Export CSV, Import CSV, Clear, and Manual Check buttons), a modal for CSV import, status dots for posts, and SVG icons for buttons, integrated from the 0.6.4 UI/UX design. Safeguards include a 1000-article cap enforced in `identifyPosts`, manual mode default (`isManualCheckEnabled = true`), configurable timing (debounce/throttle), and minimal server activity (tab checks throttled at 5000ms). The build script removes ESM exports for compatibility, and `npm run build` is the correct command. Tests (112 across 17 suites) cover core functionality, with CSV tests pending due to ESM mocking issues. Manual testing in progress: "Hide" functionality fixed with proper sizing and initial position persistence (panel starts at `top: '60px'`, `right: '10px'`, saves position after dragging), but issues foundâ€”(1) hiding after moving reverts to original position and collapses toward top/left corner (expected: collapse to current top/right, Show/Hide button stationary), (2) PROBLEM posts show in panel with red dot but lack red UI highlight, (3) Clear button reports posts cleared, yet Export CSV outputs previous list. Remaining tests (button functionality, 1000-article cap, eye icon visibility) pending.

== Code Guidelines
See `_grok-step1-master-prompt.txt.adoc` for full guidelines. Key points: use full blocks or files, state file locations before blocks, ensure copy-paste readiness.
