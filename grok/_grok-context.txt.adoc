= Grok Context for xGhosted Project
:revision-date: March 26, 2025

== Purpose
This file is an optional snapshot of my (Grok 3, built by xAI) understanding of the xGhosted project as of March 26, 2025, supplementing the primary context in `_grok-step[1-4]` files per `_grok-readme-first.txt`. Use it as a quick reference to my current state, but always start with `_grok-step[1-4]` for authoritative guidance.

== Project Snapshot
Assisting with xGhosted at version 0.6.1, a Tampermonkey userscript (`xGhosted.user.js`) built from `xGhosted.js` and dependencies via `build-xGhosted.js` using esbuild. Key features include DOM-only post analysis (PROBLEM: red, POTENTIAL_PROBLEM: yellow, GOOD/UNDEFINED: none), a resizable/draggable panel with CSV export/import/clear, and persistence via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`. Safeguards include a 1000-article cap enforced in `identifyPosts`, manual mode default (`isManualCheckEnabled = true`), configurable timing (debounce/throttle), and minimal server activity (tab checks throttled at 5000ms). The build script removes ESM exports for compatibility, and `npm run build` (not `npm build`) is the correct command due to npm’s script conventions. Tests (112 across 19 suites) cover core functionality, with CSV tests pending due to ESM mocking issues. Manual testing in progress: "Hide" functionality fixed, Show/Hide button positioning and POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection pending, along with remaining button tests, 1000-article cap verification, and eye icon visibility fix.

== Code Guidelines
- Use full blocks or files, no snippets unless requested.
- Avoid inline comments like "// In src/xGhosted.js"—state file locations before blocks.
- Ensure code is copy-paste ready for user convenience.
