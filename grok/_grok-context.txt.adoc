= Grok Context for xGhosted v0.6.1
:revision-date: March 29, 2025

== Roadmap to 0.6.1 Release
- [x] Fix Show/Hide positioning and collapse behavior (Issue 2: After moving the panel, hiding it reverts to original position and collapses toward top-left; expected to collapse to current top-right). Resolved: Panel now collapses to current top-right position, button stays stationary.
- [x] Resolve PROBLEM post highlighting (Issue 3: PROBLEM posts appear in panel with red dot but lack red highlight in UI). Resolved: PROBLEM posts now highlighted red in UI.
- [x] Ensure Clear button fully resets state for Export CSV (Issue 4: After clearing posts, Export CSV still outputs the previous list, indicating an incomplete state reset). Resolved: Clear button now fully resets state, Export CSV reflects cleared state.
- [ ] Fix POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection inconsistencies (Issue 5: POTENTIAL_PROBLEM posts not consistently detected). Resolved: Updated `findReplyingToWithDepth.js` for more robust detection.
- [x] Fix 1000-article cap message appearing prematurely (Issue 6: "Reached max processed articles (1000)" appears even with fewer posts, due to persisted state). Resolved: Removed persistence of `processedArticles`.
- [x] Fix missing red dot in panel for PROBLEM posts (Issue 7: Red dot indicating PROBLEM status is missing in the panel, likely due to CSS or class mismatch in `renderPanel.js`). Resolved: Fixed class name to `status-problem` in `renderPanel.js`.

== Manual Testing
- [ ] Test button functionality: Clear/Export CSV state reset (Issue 4). Resolved: Clear button resets state, Export CSV works as expected.
- [ ] Test eye icon visibility for POTENTIAL_PROBLEM posts. Resolved: Added `zIndex: '10000'` to ensure visibility.
- [ ] Test POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection consistency (Issue 5). Resolved: Detection now consistent.
- [x] Test 1000-article cap enforcement (Issue 6: Resolved by removing persistence of `processedArticles`). Confirmed: Cap enforced correctly.
- [ ] Test Show/Hide positioning after drag (Issue 2: Resolved). Confirmed: Panel collapses to current top-right position.
- [x] Test red dot visibility in panel for PROBLEM posts (Issue 7). Confirmed: Red dot now visible.
