= Grok Context for xGhosted v0.6.1
:revision-date: March 29, 2025

== Roadmap to 0.6.1 Release
- [ ] Fix Show/Hide positioning and collapse behavior (Issue 2: After moving the panel, hiding it reverts to original position and collapses toward top-left; expected to collapse to current top-right). Note: Overlap with theme selector fixed, but core positioning issue remains.
- [x] Resolve PROBLEM post highlighting (Issue 3: PROBLEM posts appear in panel with red dot but lack red highlight in UI).
- [ ] Ensure Clear button fully resets state for Export CSV (Issue 4: After clearing posts, Export CSV still outputs the previous list, indicating an incomplete state reset).
- [ ] Fix POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection inconsistencies (Issue 5: POTENTIAL_PROBLEM posts not consistently detected).
- [x] Fix 1000-article cap message appearing prematurely (Issue 6: "Reached max processed articles (1000)" appears even with fewer posts, due to persisted state).
- [ ] Fix missing red dot in panel for PROBLEM posts (Issue 7: Red dot indicating PROBLEM status is missing in the panel, likely due to CSS or class mismatch in `renderPanel.js`).

== Manual Testing
- [ ] Test button functionality: Clear/Export CSV state reset (Issue 4).
- [ ] Test eye icon visibility for POTENTIAL_PROBLEM posts.
- [ ] Test POTENTIAL_PROBLEM detection consistency (Issue 5).
- [x] Test 1000-article cap enforcement (Issue 6: Resolved by removing persistence of `processedArticles`).
- [ ] Test Show/Hide positioning after drag (Issue 2: Partially fixed; overlap resolved, but positioning issue persists).
- [ ] Test red dot visibility in panel for PROBLEM posts (Issue 7).
